## The Rules

1. **Pillar name on every card.** The audience must learn CLARITY, COURAGE, COMMITMENT, MOVEMENT.
2. **Direct story connection.** Each card references what Batman just did — then shows it at work.
3. **Simple.** One read. No decoding.
4. **Universal.** No jargon. Any professional sees themselves.

---

## Card Format

Each card has three layers:
1. **PILLAR NAME** — top, bold, colored (the word they remember)
2. **Story echo** — what Batman just did (one line)
3. **Your moment** — what it looks like at work (one line)

# EP1 POST-CREDITS TAKEAWAY

## "Learn the Framework"

*Ra's just taught Bruce the four pillars through fire. Now connect each pillar to the audience's own foundation — their first role, their first mentor, their first year.*

---

### OPENER [TEXT]

> **Black card. White text. Centered.**
>
> *"Ra's lit the fire. Bruce walked through it.*
> *Four pillars forged — by a mentor who knew*
> *the student would one day surpass him."*

---

### CARD 1 — CLARITY [TEXT or IMAGE]

> **Top (bold, blue #4A90D9):** CLARITY
>
> **Story echo:**
> *Bruce was blindfolded. He couldn't see.*
> *Ra's said: "Always mind your surroundings."*
> *He stopped trying to see everything — and noticed what mattered.*
>
> **Your moment:**
> *Your first role. New team. New tools. New language.*
> *Everything was coming at you.*
> *Someone told you — don't try to learn everything.*
> *Focus on what matters first.*
>
> **If image:** A person on their first day, standing at the entrance of an open office. Everything is new. They're not lost — they're choosing where to look first.

---

### CARD 2 — COURAGE [TEXT or IMAGE]

> **Top (bold, red #EF4444):** COURAGE
>
> **Story echo:**
> *Bruce entered a cave full of bats — the thing*
> *that terrified him since childhood.*
> *He didn't fight them. He didn't run.*
> *He stood still and let them come.*
>
> **Your moment:**
> *The first time you spoke up in a room*
> *where everyone knew more than you.*
> *You weren't sure if you were right.*
> *You said it anyway.*
>
> **If image:** A person in a meeting, speaking up. Others are more senior. The person looks nervous but they're saying it. That first time you raised your hand.

---

### CARD 3 — COMMITMENT [TEXT or IMAGE]

> **Top (bold, white/silver #D1D5DB):** COMMITMENT
>
> **Story echo:**
> *Ra's told Bruce to execute a prisoner.*
> *Complete the training. Join the League.*
> *Bruce raised the sword — then lowered it.*
> *"I will fight injustice. But I will not become it."*
> *He burned the temple to make it irreversible.*
>
> **Your moment:**
> *Someone asked you to do something*
> *that got the job done but didn't sit right.*
> *The shortcut. The workaround. The "everyone does it."*
> *You said no. And you meant it.*
>
> **If image:** A person at a desk, gently pushing a document back across the table. Not angry. Just clear. "I'll find another way."

---

### CARD 4 — MOVEMENT [TEXT or IMAGE]

> **Top (bold, orange #F97316):** MOVEMENT
>
> **Story echo:**
> *Wayne Manor burned to the ground.*
> *Everything Bruce had — his home, his legacy,*
> *his plan — gone in one night.*
> *Alfred pulled him from the fire.*
> *The next morning, he started building.*
>
> **Your moment:**
> *The project that failed. The plan that fell apart.*
> *The thing you worked on for months — gone.*
> *You showed up the next morning.*
> *Not because someone told you to.*
> *Because that's what you do.*
>
> **If image:** A person walking into work the morning after something went wrong. Coffee in hand. Tired. But walking in. That's movement.

---

### CLOSER [TEXT]

> **Black card. White text. Centered.**
>
> *"Someone showed you the way.*
> *You walked through it.*
> *That's how the four pillars start."*

### EP1 Takeaway Summary

| Card | Pillar | Story Moment | Work Moment |
|------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | CLARITY | Blindfold — notice what matters | First role — focus on what counts |
| 2 | COURAGE | Cave — face the fear, stand still | First meeting — speak up anyway |
| 3 | COMMITMENT | Execution — lower the sword, burn the temple | The shortcut — say no, mean it |
| 4 | MOVEMENT | Manor burns — start building next morning | The failure — show up anyway |

**Total: 6 cards** (opener + 4 pillars + closer)

---

### What Makes This Different From v3.0

| v3.0 (Previous) | v3.1 (This) |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Generic work images | Direct story echo → then work mirror |
| Pillar names hidden | **Pillar name is the headline** |
| "Everything was new" | "Bruce was blindfolded. Ra's said mind your surroundings." → THEN your first role |
| Standalone moments | Each card ties Batman's scene to YOUR scene |

The audience should think: *"Oh — THAT scene was about CLARITY. And that's what I did in my first year."*
