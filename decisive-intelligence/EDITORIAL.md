## Editorial Criteria (DI-Specific)

### Accessibility Checks
- [ ] Non-comic readers can follow the story

- [ ] Villain motivations are understandable
- [ ] Emotional beats land for leadership audience

### Pacing Checks
- [ ] EP1 maintains tension throughout (pre-event hook)
- [ ] EP2 balances teaching with narrative engagement
- [ ] EP3 delivers payoff + leaves intentional questions

### Continuity Checks
- [ ] Costume variations consistent within episodes
- [ ] Character positioning (standing/seated) tracked
- [ ] Joker face-to-face moments properly staged
- [ ] Famous lines placed at maximum impact moments

### Framework Integration Checks
- [ ] Four pillars clearly demonstrated (EP1)
- [ ] Four pillars clearly named and taught (EP2)
- [ ] Four pillars clearly adapted to new threat (EP3)
- [ ] Flywheel concept lands

## Delivery Architecture Notes

| Episode | Delivery | Editorial Consideration |
|---------|----------|------------------------|
| EP1 | Pre-event (cold) | Must hook WITHOUT framework vocabulary |
| EP2 | During event (in-person) | Must work WITH live deck + simulation |
| EP3 | Post-event (takeaway) | Must create productive CONFUSION |

**Key:** EP3's confusion is intentional. Editorial should NOT over-clarify.

  - Choice #4 (MOVEMENT): Become the villain to save the city — Scene 20-22

### 2026-02-15 — EP1 FOUNDATION Prompts v3 Revision Request

- **Director request:** Tighter cut — 55-60 slides (down from 94)
