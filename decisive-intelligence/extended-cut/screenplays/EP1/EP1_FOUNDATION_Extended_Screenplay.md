## GEMINI SAFETY NOTES (Extended Cut)

| Concern | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Young Bruce (opera, murder, well) | ALL silhouette — back-turned or shadow. No detailed child face. Proven safe in KLP. |
| Murder scene | NO graphic violence. Black pages + sound effects + pearls. No blood, no bodies shown in detail. |
| Thomas Wayne | Linus Roache actor name in character blocks. Fixes KLP rendering inconsistency. |
| Lucius Fox (new) | Morgan Freeman — needs Gemini testing. Lab coat + glasses = low risk. |
| Young Gordon (new) | Gary Oldman in police uniform, younger. Actor name required (without = Bryan Cranston). |
| Dock fight (new) | Shadows, aftermath only. No graphic violence — thugs unconscious and tied, not bleeding. |
