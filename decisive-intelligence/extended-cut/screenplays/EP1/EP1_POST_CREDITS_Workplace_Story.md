## CONCEPT

The audience just watched Ra's Al Ghul train Bruce Wayne in a monastery.
Four pillars forged through fire — CLARITY, COURAGE, COMMITMENT, MOVEMENT.

Now the SAME characters appear in a modern workplace.
Same faces. Same dynamic. Different universe.

**Ra's Al Ghul** → Senior leader, the mentor who guides the new hire
**Bruce Wayne** → Experienced professional, new to this role and this team
**Alfred Pennyworth** → The colleague who's been there — steady, supportive, shows you the ropes
**Gordon** → The peer who believes in your potential before you've proven anything

The audience should feel: *"Wait — that's Ra's. In a suit. In an office. Teaching the same thing."*

## SETTING

Modern office. Clean but lived-in. Glass-walled meeting rooms. Open floor plan with desks. A kitchen/break area. Morning light through large windows. City skyline visible outside.

**NOT** a tech startup. **NOT** a corporate dungeon. Just a normal, recognizable workplace. Could be any company in any city.

---

# THE SCREENPLAY

---

## PANEL 1 — THE ARRIVAL

**Composition:** Wide shot. A modern office entrance. Glass doors. Morning light. Bruce Wayne walks in — blazer, no tie, laptop bag over his shoulder. He pauses at the entrance. Takes it in. New badge in his hand, lanyard not yet around his neck.

Behind the reception, through the glass walls, the office buzzes — people at desks, screens glowing, a meeting already in progress somewhere.

**Caption Box (narrator voice):**
*"When you step into a new role, the first thing you hear isn't clarity."*

**Caption Box:**
*"It's noise."*

---

## PANEL 2 — THE NOISE

**Composition:** Bruce at a desk. First day. His screen shows a wall of tabs — onboarding docs, org charts, product wikis, a calendar packed with "intro" meetings. Sticky notes from whoever sat here before. A welcome packet untouched beside the keyboard.

He's staring at all of it. Not overwhelmed — but aware of how much he doesn't know yet.

**Caption Box:**
*"New systems. New language. New faces. Side conversations you're not part of yet."*

**Caption Box:**
*"Everyone seems to know something you don't."*

---

## PANEL 3 — THE MENTOR APPEARS

**Composition:** Ra's Al Ghul walks up to Bruce's desk. Suit. No tie. Coffee in hand. The same calm authority — but here it looks like a senior leader checking in on the new person.

He doesn't sit. He stands. Looks at Bruce's screen full of tabs.

**Speech Bubble (Ra's):** "Close them."

Bruce looks up — surprised.

**Speech Bubble (Ra's):** "All of them. You're trying to see everything. That's why you can't see anything."

---

## PANEL 4 — CLARITY

**Composition:** Close on Bruce's face. Something clicks. The same face he made when Ra's said "Always mind your surroundings" in the monastery — but here, in office light, over a laptop.

Ra's is already walking away. Doesn't look back.

**Speech Bubble (Ra's, walking away):** "Focus on one thing today. Just one. The rest will still be there tomorrow."

**Caption Box (bold, blue #4A90D9):**
***"CLARITY.***
*Not seeing everything. Seeing what matters."*

---

## PANEL 5 — THE MEETING

**Composition:** A meeting room. Glass walls. Eight people around a table. Bruce is the newest person in the room. Everyone else has context, history, opinions.

A discussion is happening — people debating an approach. Some are loud. Some are checked out. Bruce is listening. He has a thought. His hand is on the table, fingers tapping once — the small nervous tell before someone speaks up.

**Caption Box:**
*"Most professionals carry invisible fears."*

**Caption Box:**
*"A wrong answer in a previous job. A story about someone who spoke too soon and was dismissed."*

---

## PANEL 6 — COURAGE

**Composition:** Bruce speaks. Mid-sentence. The room is looking at him. Some curious, some skeptical. He's not confident — he's committed. There's a difference.

At the far end of the table, Ra's is watching. Arms crossed. A faint look — not approval, not disapproval. Observation. The mentor seeing if the student will do it.

**Speech Bubble (Bruce):** "What if we're solving the wrong problem?"

Silence in the room.

**Caption Box (bold, red #EF4444):**
***"COURAGE.***
*Not knowing if you're right. Saying it anyway."*

---

## PANEL 7 — THE SHORTCUT

**Composition:** Later. Bruce at his desk with a colleague (NOT one of our main characters — just a coworker). The colleague is leaning over, pointing at Bruce's screen, suggesting something. Casual. Friendly. "Everyone does this."

**Speech Bubble (Colleague):** "Just copy the numbers from last quarter's report. No one checks."

**Caption Box:**
*"There's always a faster way."*

**Caption Box:**
*"Someone will offer it to you. It'll sound reasonable."*

---

## PANEL 8 — COMMITMENT

**Composition:** Bruce's face. He looks at the colleague. Not angry. Not self-righteous. Just clear.

**Speech Bubble (Bruce):** "I'd rather take longer and get it right."

The colleague shrugs and walks away. Bruce turns back to his screen. Alone with the harder choice.

**Caption Box (bold, silver #D1D5DB):**
***"COMMITMENT.***
*Drawing the line. Holding it. Even when no one's watching."*

---

## PANEL 9 — THE FAILURE

**Composition:** Wide shot. End of a bad day. The office is half-empty — evening light. Bruce is at his desk. Papers and notes spread out. His screen shows something gone wrong — a report with red marks, an email chain that got difficult.

Alfred is nearby — at the desk across from him. Still there. Working on his own thing but present. He looks over.

**Speech Bubble (Alfred):** "Rough one?"

**Speech Bubble (Bruce):** "I thought I had it. I didn't."

---

## PANEL 10 — ALFRED'S WISDOM

**Composition:** Alfred leans back in his chair. Glasses on. The look of someone who's seen a hundred first years. Kind. Not patronizing.

**Speech Bubble (Alfred):** "First month, sir? They're all rough ones."

A pause. Then:

**Speech Bubble (Alfred):** "The ones who stay are the ones who show up tomorrow."

**Caption Box:**
*"Not advice. Just truth. From someone who's been where you are."*

---

## PANEL 11 — MOVEMENT

**Composition:** Next morning. Same office entrance from Panel 1. Bruce walks in again. Coffee in hand. Laptop bag. Same door. Same badge.

But he's different. Not fixed. Not healed. Just... back.

Behind him through the glass, the office is already buzzing. Another day.

Gordon is walking in at the same time — catches Bruce's eye. A nod. Simple. One professional to another. *You're here. Good.*

**Caption Box (bold, orange #F97316):**
***"MOVEMENT.***
*It fell apart. You showed up anyway. That's how it starts."*

---

## PANEL 12 — THE FOUR PILLARS

**Composition:** Wide shot from above — the office floor. Bruce walking to his desk. Ra's visible in a glass office in the background. Alfred already at his desk. Gordon heading to his.

Morning light. A normal day. Except the audience now sees it differently.

Four caption boxes, arranged across the panel:

**Caption Box (blue):** *"See what matters."*
**Caption Box (red):** *"Say it anyway."*
**Caption Box (silver):** *"Hold the line."*
**Caption Box (orange):** *"Show up tomorrow."*

---

## PANEL 13 — CLOSER

**Composition:** Black card. White text. Centered.

*"Someone showed you the way.*
*You walked through it.*
*The framework starts here."*

---

## PANEL 14 — S.P. EASTER EGG

**Composition:** Quick panel — Bruce's desk. Among the onboarding documents and sticky notes, one small detail: a Post-it note stuck to the monitor, handwritten in neat script:

*"SP's first rule: Focus on what matters. — Alfred"*

Blink and you miss it.
