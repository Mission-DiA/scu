COMPOSITION:
- THREE VERTICAL PANELS side by side, thin white lines (1-2px) dividing
- LEFT: Gothic English manor (Wayne Manor) against stormy sky, lightning flash. Overgrown garden in foreground. A SILHOUETTE of a small child walking across what looks like normal ground — but the ground is actually OLD WOODEN BOARDS hidden beneath thick overgrown grass, weeds, moss, and fallen leaves. One foot CRACKING THROUGH the hidden boards, the other still on solid ground. The vegetation CONCEALS the well cover completely — it looks like ordinary garden ground until the moment it breaks. Child is a BLACK SILHOUETTE — NO FACE DETAIL.
- CENTER: SILHOUETTE of small figure falling through black void, arms outstretched, well opening shrinking above — SHADOW ONLY
- RIGHT: Cave floor impact, dust cloud, small crumpled SHADOW FIGURE among rocks — NO FACE VISIBLE
