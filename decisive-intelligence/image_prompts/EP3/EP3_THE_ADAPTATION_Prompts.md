### SLIDE 21 — REBUILDING COURAGE (TRIPTYCH)
**TRIPTYCH — THE FAILED CLIMBS**

```
PROMPT:
Create a photorealistic, cinematic comic panel in 16:9 aspect ratio. Dark Knight noir style. TRIPTYCH (3 vertical panels).

SCENE: Bruce attempts the Pit climb with a safety rope — reaches the final ledge, leaps upward, and MISSES. Then back on the cot, the Blind Prisoner reveals why.

COMPOSITION:
- THREE VERTICAL PANELS side by side, thin white lines (1-2px) dividing
- LEFT: Bruce climbing the Pit wall, rope tied around waist, prisoners chanting below
- CENTER: Bruce mid-leap UPWARD inside the vertical Pit shaft, arms reaching UP toward a stone ledge above him, rope tied around waist trailing below, light from Pit opening far above — his fingers JUST MISS the ledge
- RIGHT: Bruce on the cot, defeated, Blind Prisoner seated beside him — the dialogue about the rope

CRITICAL LAYOUT: The Pit is a VERTICAL stone shaft — NOT a horizontal chasm. Bruce climbs UPWARD along stone walls. The jump is UPWARD to grab a ledge ABOVE him. All three panels should show vertical stone walls rising around him.

LEFT — THE CLIMB (WITH ROPE):
BRUCE WAYNE (PRISON - CLIMBING) FULL DESCRIPTION:
- Face & Body: Christian Bale, Caucasian man, mid-40s, beard shorter, some strength returned, intense focused eyes, 6'0"
- Costume: Torn grey (#6B7280) prison shirt, dark brown torn trousers, THICK ROPE clearly tied around his waist — the rope trails DOWN below him to the ground far below
- Expression: Determined, straining, teeth gritted
- Action: Climbing stone wall with bare hands, gripping rough stone
- Position: Partway up the Pit wall, body pressed against stone, feet on narrow ledges, rope hanging below him

ENVIRONMENT:
- Vertical stone walls of the Pit rising around him
- Other prisoners visible FAR BELOW, tiny figures looking up
- Cells carved into walls at various heights
- Dim light from above

PRISONERS BELOW:
- Watching from below, faces upturned
- Speech bubble (multiple voices, rising from below): "Deshi basara! Deshi basara!"

CENTER — THE FAILED JUMP:
BRUCE WAYNE (PRISON - MID-LEAP) FULL DESCRIPTION:
- Face & Body: Christian Bale, Caucasian man, mid-40s, beard, straining face looking UP, 6'0"
- Costume: Torn grey prison shirt, dark brown trousers, ROPE tied around his waist — rope hanging taut below him
- Expression: Maximum effort, desperate, eyes locked on the ledge above
- Action: Mid-leap UPWARD — BOTH ARMS fully extended above his head, fingers outstretched reaching for stone ledge. NOT gripping anything. Both hands are in the AIR. He is MISSING the ledge.
- Position: Fully airborne, body vertical, launched upward from a lower ledge

CRITICAL COMPOSITION FOR THIS PANEL:
- Camera angle: FROM BELOW, looking UP at Bruce — we see the underside of his outstretched arms against the distant light above
- Bruce is at the PEAK of his jump — the instant before gravity pulls him back
- BOTH HANDS reaching UP with fingers spread wide — grabbing at air, NOT touching any surface
- A rough stone ledge is visible ABOVE his fingertips — there is a clear GAP between his fingers and the stone. He CANNOT reach it. This gap is the story.
- The circle of daylight (Pit opening) is visible FAR ABOVE the ledge — freedom, impossibly distant
- The ROPE trails below him, hanging taut from his waist downward into darkness
- Below him: the Pit shaft drops away, other prisoners visible as tiny figures far below
- NO HANDS GRIPPING ANYTHING — this is the frozen moment of failure

RIGHT — THE LESSON (ON THE COT):
BRUCE WAYNE (PRISON) FULL DESCRIPTION:
- Face & Body: Christian Bale, Caucasian man, mid-40s, beard, hollow defeated eyes, 6'0"
- Costume: Torn grey prison shirt, dark brown trousers, rope STILL tied around his waist — visual reminder of the safety net
- Expression: Defeated, frustrated, searching for answers
- Position: Lying on simple stone cot, looking at the Blind Prisoner beside him

- Face & Body: Middle Eastern man, late 60s, completely blind — clouded white eyes, weathered face with deep wrinkles, thin grey beard, frail build, 5'8"
- Costume: Ragged grey prison clothes, cloth wrapped around hands
- Expression: Knowing, calm, seeing truth without eyes
- Position: Seated on stool beside Bruce's cot, facing him

DIALOGUE:
- Speech bubble (white, black text) from Bruce: "Why can't I make the jump?"
- Speech bubble (white, black text) from Blind Prisoner: "The rope. The safety net."

ATMOSPHERE:
- Three-beat story: climb → fail → understand why
- The rope is the VISUAL THREAD across all three panels — climbing with it, jumping with it, lying with it
- Safety net preventing the leap that matters

TEXT OVERLAY:
- Caption (RED #EF4444 background, white text) LEFT panel top: "COURAGE — act without certainty."

STYLE: Photorealistic, cinematic, triptych. Full bleed to all edges. WATERMARK: "DI × SCU" bottom-left corner, white/grey, 25-30% opacity, barely visible.

SCENE: Bruce climbs the Pit WITHOUT the rope for the first time. No safety net. Every movement is life or death. He reaches the impossible ledge, leaps, and THIS TIME — he catches it.

- Position: At base of the Pit, one hand on wall, looking upward

- This is the moment of decision — jump or climb back down

BOTTOM LEFT — THE LEAP (HE COMMITS):
BRUCE WAYNE (PRISON - MID-LEAP) FULL DESCRIPTION:
- Face & Body: Christian Bale, Caucasian man, mid-40s, beard, face looking UP with total commitment, 6'0"

## GEMINI COMPATIBILITY NOTES

**Applied from EP1/EP2 learnings:**

1. **Actor names INCLUDED in character blocks** — required for correct likeness (v1.1.0 fix: generic descriptions caused wrong actor renders, e.g. Ben Affleck instead of Christian Bale)
2. **NO children in threatening situations** — all family content removed or handled off-frame
3. **Full character blocks in EVERY panel** — no lazy references
4. **Scene 8.4 (Slide 13) — NO TEXT** — maximum impact preserved
5. **RDJ reveal (Slide 41)** — full face, clear lighting, no ambiguity
6. **New chessboard (Slide 43)** — MORE pieces, visual escalation
