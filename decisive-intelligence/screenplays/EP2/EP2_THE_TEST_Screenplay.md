# OPENING: THE BOARD

---

## SCENE 1: COVER
**Location:** Gotham skyline, night
**Purpose:** Establish tone, connect to EP1

### Panel 1.1 — COVER IMAGE
**Visual:** Gotham skyline at night. Dark. Massive. Rain-slicked streets far below. A single chessboard sits on a rooftop ledge, four pieces prominent — Knight (blue), Queen (red), Rook (white), Bishop (orange). The city burns in soft orange glow behind it — multiple fires, distant chaos. A Joker playing card lies beside the board, face-up, grinning. This is the card Gordon showed Batman at the end of EP1.

**Text Elements:**
- TITLE: "DECISIVE INTELLIGENCE" — white, clean sans-serif, prominent
- SUBTITLE: "The Test" — smaller, beneath title
- EPISODE: "Episode 2" — smallest

**Atmosphere:** The framework from EP1 is about to be tested. The game has escalated.

---

## SCENE 2: THE BOARD SPEAKS
**Location:** Rooftop, close on chessboard
**Purpose:** Connect to EP1, introduce the test

### Panel 2.1 — THE CHESSBOARD (CLOSE)
**Visual:** Extreme close-up of the chessboard. The four prominent pieces — Knight, Queen, Rook, Bishop — glow faintly in their colors (blue, red, white, orange). Batman's gloved hand hovers above, not touching. He's remembering.

**Caption Box:** "Ra's taught him the framework."

### Panel 2.2 — FLASHBACK: RA'S
**Visual:** Quick flash — Ra's Al Ghul in the monastery, training Bruce. Semi-transparent overlay. The memory.

**Caption Box:** "Four principles. Forged in fire."

### Panel 2.3 — THE JOKER CARD
**Visual:** Close on the Joker card from EP1's ending. Crude drawing. Grinning face. Evidence bag visible at edge.

**Caption Box:** "But the Joker doesn't play by anyone's rules."

### Panel 2.4 — FOUR CRISES (GHOSTLY)
**Visual:** Same chessboard, but now four ghostly overlays float above it — transparent images of four simultaneous crises. Ferry A with detonator. Ferry B with prisoners. A warehouse with Rachel tied to a chair. A warehouse with Harvey tied to a chair. All semi-transparent, overlapping, creating visual chaos ABOVE the ordered board.

**Caption Box:** "He wants to see if the framework breaks."

### Panel 2.5 — JOKER'S EYES (EXTREME CLOSE)
**Visual:** Extreme close-up of the Joker's eyes. Just the eyes. Manic. Calculating. Delighted.

**Caption Box:** "Tonight, everything gets tested."

---

# ACT 1: THE CHAOS

---

## SCENE 3: THE JOKER'S GAME
**Location:** Multiple Gotham locations (fragmented)
**Purpose:** Establish the four simultaneous crises — cognitive overload

### Panel 3.1 — FERRY A
**Visual:** Interior of a ferry. Civilians — families, elderly, children — huddled in fear. A DETONATOR sits on a table in the center. No one is touching it. Through the windows, another ferry is visible in the distance. Night. Water. Tension.

**No dialogue — image only**

### Panel 3.2 — FERRY B
**Visual:** Interior of the second ferry. PRISONERS in orange jumpsuits, hands cuffed, guarded by nervous SWAT officers. A matching DETONATOR sits on a table. A massive prisoner (TATTOOS, SCARS) stares at the detonator. Night. Water. Same tension, different stakes.

**No dialogue — image only**

### Panel 3.3 — WAREHOUSE A (RACHEL)
**Visual:** A dark warehouse. RACHEL DAWES tied to a chair, gasoline barrels surrounding her, a TIMER counting down (showing 4:32). She's conscious, terrified but defiant. Oil drums. Industrial decay. A phone lies on the floor nearby.

**No dialogue — image only**

### Panel 3.4 — WAREHOUSE B (HARVEY)
**Visual:** A different warehouse. HARVEY DENT tied to a chair, same setup — gasoline, timer (showing 4:28 — slightly less time), phone on floor. Half his face is pressed against a puddle of gasoline. He's struggling against the ropes. Desperate.

**No dialogue — image only**

### Panel 3.5 — FOUR CRISES (FRAGMENTED LAYOUT)
**Visual:** All four previous panels shown together in a FRAGMENTED, OVERLAPPING layout. Panels at angles, edges bleeding into each other. The visual composition itself creates cognitive overload. This is what Batman sees. This is what the Joker designed.

**Caption Box:** "The Joker doesn't want chaos."

### Panel 3.6 — THE JOKER (FIRST FULL APPEARANCE)
**Visual:** THE JOKER in extreme close-up. Just his face filling the panel. Smeared makeup. Glasgow scars. Those eyes — manic, calculating, delighted. He's looking directly at us.

**Joker Speech (jagged bubble):** "Tick tock, Batman."

**Caption Box:** "He wants you to create it by trying to stop it."

---

## SCENE 4: BATMAN PARALYZED
**Location:** The Batcave
**Purpose:** Show information overload leading to paralysis

### Panel 4.1 — THE BATCAVE (WIDE)
**Visual:** The Batcave — massive, dark, filled with screens. BATMAN stands at the center console, surrounded by monitors showing all four crises simultaneously. Police scanners, news feeds, GPS tracking, audio channels — all demanding attention. He's not moving. He's frozen.

**Caption Box:** "The problem isn't lack of information."

### Panel 4.2 — BATMAN'S EYES (CLOSE)
**Visual:** Extreme close-up on Batman's eyes through the cowl. They're moving rapidly — left, right, up, down — trying to process everything. Overwhelmed. Uncertainty visible.

**Caption Box:** "It's too much of it."

### Panel 4.3 — THE SCREENS (DETAIL)
**Visual:** Close-up on the multiple screens. Each one showing a different crisis, a different countdown, a different demand. Text overlays, GPS coordinates, radio chatter visualized as waveforms. Pure noise.

**Radio chatter (multiple overlapping speech bubbles, small, chaotic):**
- "Ferry A reports civilian panic—"
- "Harvey Dent's tracker went dark at—"
- "Gotham General evacuation sixty percent—"
- "Rachel Dawes last seen—"

---

## SCENE 5: THE JOKER'S VOICE
**Location:** Batcave (audio intrusion)
**Purpose:** Joker's first direct communication — establishing his philosophy

### Panel 5.1 — THE JOKER'S CALL
**Visual:** Batman at the console. One screen has changed — it now shows a PHONE ICON, incoming call. All other screens still showing chaos. Batman's hand reaches for the answer button.

**No dialogue — tension**

### Panel 5.2 — JOKER ON SCREEN
**Visual:** The screen now shows THE JOKER, filming himself on a shaky handheld camera. Behind him, unclear location — could be anywhere. He's grinning. Makeup fresh. This was planned.

**Joker Speech (jagged):** "Do I really look like a guy with a plan?"

### Panel 5.3 — JOKER CONTINUES
**Visual:** Same shot, Joker leaning closer to the camera. Intimate. Conspiratorial.

**Joker Speech (jagged):** "I'm just a dog chasing cars. I wouldn't know what to do with one if I caught it."

### Panel 5.4 — JOKER'S ULTIMATUM
**Visual:** Joker pulling back, spreading his arms wide. Behind him, we now see BOTH warehouses shown on smaller screens — Rachel in one, Harvey in the other. He's showing Batman the choice.

**Joker Speech (jagged):** "You can save ONE of them. Only one. Your call, Bats."

**Joker Speech (jagged):** "Rachel... or Harvey. Tick tock."

### Panel 5.5 — BATMAN'S REACTION
**Visual:** Batman's full body in the Batcave. Shoulders tense. Fists clenched. The screens behind him show Rachel and Harvey — both timers now under 4 minutes. He's still not moving.

**Batman Internal Monologue:** "He's lying. He has to be lying. There has to be another way."

---

## SCENE 6: THE FRAMEWORK SURFACES
**Location:** Batcave
**Purpose:** Batman remembers Ra's training — setup for CLARITY

### Panel 6.1 — BATMAN FROZEN
**Visual:** Batman standing before screens, paralyzed by choices. His reflection visible in the dark glass between monitors.

**Caption Box:** "Ra's voice echoed in his mind."

### Panel 6.2 — FLASHBACK: RA'S TRAINING
**Visual:** Semi-transparent overlay — Ra's Al Ghul in the monastery, blindfolded training scene from EP1.

**Ra's Speech (ghostly):** "Always mind your surroundings."

### Panel 6.3 — FLASHBACK: THE LESSON
**Visual:** Another flash — Ra's and Bruce face to face, the execution refusal scene.

**Ra's Speech (ghostly):** "The training is nothing. The will to act is everything."

### Panel 6.4 — BATMAN'S EYES (CLARITY MOMENT)
**Visual:** Batman's eyes. Something is changing. The chaos is the same, but he's seeing differently.

**Caption Box:** "The framework was there. He just needed to use it."

---

# ACT 2: CLARITY
## "Know what matters — even when everything is on fire."

---

## SCENE 7: ALFRED'S INTERVENTION
**Location:** Batcave
**Purpose:** The CLARITY moment — ruthless subtraction

### Panel 7.1 — ALFRED ENTERS
**Visual:** ALFRED PENNYWORTH walks into frame from the right. He's carrying a tea tray — but his expression is all business. He sees the screens. He sees Batman frozen. He sets down the tray.

**No dialogue — action**

### Panel 7.2 — ALFRED APPROACHES CONSOLE
**Visual:** Alfred walking past Batman, directly to the console. Batman doesn't stop him. Alfred's hand reaches for the screen controls. Determined.

**Alfred Speech:** "Master Wayne."

### Panel 7.3 — ALFRED ACTS
**Visual:** Alfred's hand on the console. He's TURNING OFF screens. The ferry feeds — gone. The hospital evacuation — gone. The news broadcasts — gone. He's physically removing the noise.

**Alfred Speech:** "You can't save everyone tonight."

### Panel 7.4 — TWO SCREENS REMAIN
**Visual:** Wide shot of the console. Where there were twelve screens of chaos, now only TWO remain lit. Rachel's warehouse. Harvey's warehouse. Both timers visible. The visual noise has been eliminated. The choice is now clear.

**Alfred Speech:** "But you can stop the thing that collapses everything else."

### Panel 7.5 — BATMAN'S SHOULDERS DROP
**Visual:** Close on Batman. His shoulders have dropped. He's breathing. The paralysis is breaking. He's looking at the two remaining screens with focus, not panic.

**Caption Box:** "CLARITY: Know what matters."

### Panel 7.6 — ALFRED'S WISDOM
**Visual:** Alfred standing beside Batman, both facing the two screens. Mentor and student.

**Alfred Speech:** "Some men just want to watch the world burn. But you can't fight fire by running toward every flame."

**Caption Box:** "Filter everything else."

---

## SCENE 8: THE CHOICE
**Location:** Batcave
**Purpose:** Batman makes his choice — Rachel

### Panel 8.1 — TWO SCREENS (CLOSE)
**Visual:** The two screens side by side. LEFT: Rachel, timer at 3:42. RIGHT: Harvey, timer at 3:38. Both struggling. Both running out of time. The visual weight is equal.

**No dialogue — the visual IS the choice**

### Panel 8.2 — BATMAN'S HAND
**Visual:** Close on Batman's hand. He's pointing. At Rachel's screen. The choice is made. No dramatic gesture — just a finger pointing at what matters most to him.

**Batman Speech:** "Rachel. I'm going to Rachel."

### Panel 8.3 — ALFRED'S RESPONSE
**Visual:** Alfred's face. No judgment. Just acknowledgment. And something else — perhaps sadness.

**Alfred Speech:** "The Joker gave you her location?"

### Panel 8.4 — BATMAN MOVES
**Visual:** Batman already turning, cape swirling, heading toward the Batmobile bay. The paralysis is gone. He's in motion.

**Batman Speech:** "250 52nd Street. I can make it."

### Panel 8.5 — THE FIRST PILLAR
**Visual:** Batman leaping into the Batmobile. Motion blur. Purpose.

**Caption Box:** "The first pillar held."

**Caption Box:** "CLARITY: Know what matters — even when everything is on fire."

---

## SCENE 9: THE RACE
**Location:** Gotham streets
**Purpose:** Transition — Batman racing to Rachel

**No dialogue — pure motion**

### Panel 9.2 — GOTHAM STREETS

**Caption Box:** "Clarity shows you the board."

### Panel 9.3 — BATMAN'S FACE
**Visual:** Through the Batmobile windshield, Batman's face. Focused. Determined. No doubt. He made the choice. Now he's executing.

**Caption Box:** "But the Joker doesn't play fair."

---

**Location:** Warehouse (wrong one)
**Purpose:** The Joker's lie revealed — Batman chose right, Joker cheated

**No dialogue — urgency**

### Panel 10.2 — BATMAN CRASHES IN
**Visual:** Batman shoulder-checking through the warehouse door. Wood splintering. Motion blur. Timer in his head.

**No dialogue — action**

### Panel 10.3 — THE WRONG PERSON
**Visual:** Batman stops. In front of him: HARVEY DENT tied to the chair. NOT Rachel. Harvey is screaming, face pressed into the gasoline puddle, timer at 0:08. The Joker switched the addresses.

**Harvey Speech:** "RACHEL! WHERE IS SHE?!"

### Panel 10.4 — BATMAN'S REALIZATION
**Visual:** Close on Batman's face. Behind the cowl, we see it — the horror of understanding. He chose correctly. The Joker lied about which address was which. The game was rigged.

**Batman Internal:** "He switched the addresses..."

**Caption Box:** "Clarity worked. The Joker just cheated."

---

# ACT 3: COURAGE
## "Act before you're ready — the cost might break you."

---

**Location:** Both warehouses
**Purpose:** The COURAGE cost — Rachel dies

### Panel 11.1 — BATMAN GRABS HARVEY

**No dialogue — pure action**

**Caption Box:** "COURAGE: Act before you're ready."

### Panel 11.3 — AFTERMATH (HARVEY)
**Visual:** Batman and Harvey on the ground outside the warehouse. Harvey's face — the left side burned, skin blackened, eye exposed. He's screaming. Batman is trying to help, but he's looking toward the distant glow of the other explosion.

**Harvey Speech (broken, agonized):** "Rachel... RACHEL!"

### Panel 11.4 — DISTANT FIRE
**Visual:** Wide shot. Batman in the foreground, Harvey on the ground beside him. In the far background, a fireball rising — Rachel's warehouse.

**Caption Box:** "The cost might break you."

### Panel 11.5 — BATMAN'S FAILURE
**Visual:** Close on Batman's face. Rain mixing with smoke. Behind the cowl, he's broken. He made the choice. He did everything right. And he still lost.

---

## SCENE 12: INTERROGATION ROOM — FACE TO FACE #1
**Location:** GCPD Interrogation Room
**Purpose:** First direct confrontation — Joker's philosophy revealed

### Panel 12.1 — GCPD HALLWAY
**Visual:** GCPD headquarters. Chaotic. Officers rushing. In the center of the chaos, a holding cell. THE JOKER sits inside, hands cuffed to the table, completely calm while everything around him is pandemonium.

**Caption Box:** "The Joker wanted to be caught."

### Panel 12.2 — JOKER WAITING

**Joker Speech (jagged):** *humming* "Da da da da da..."

**Joker Speech (jagged):** "There you are."

### Panel 12.4 — BATMAN IN SHADOW
**Visual:** BATMAN emerging from the darkness. Not entering through the door — already there. The Joker doesn't flinch. He's delighted.

**Joker Speech (jagged):** "I wanted this."

### Panel 12.5 — FACE TO FACE
**Visual:** Two-shot. Batman standing over the seated Joker. Eye to eye. The power dynamic is unclear — who is really in control?

**Batman Speech:** "Where are they? Rachel and Harvey — where?"

**Joker Speech (jagged):** "Killing is making a choice."

### Panel 12.6 — JOKER'S PHILOSOPHY
**Visual:** Close on Joker's face. He's not afraid of Batman. He's studying him.

**Joker Speech (jagged):** "You chose not to save one of them. You made a choice. That makes you just like me."

### Panel 12.7 — BATMAN'S RESPONSE
**Visual:** Batman grabbing the Joker by the collar, lifting him from the chair. Violence barely contained.

**Batman Speech:** "I am NOTHING like you."

### Panel 12.8 — JOKER LAUGHS

**Visual:** Joker's face, inches from Batman's. Intimate. Terrible.

### Panel 12.10 — THE COURAGE TEST

**No dialogue — devastation**

### Panel 13.2 — NURSE ENTERS
**Visual:** A NURSE enters the room. Something's wrong with the silhouette. Too tall. Wrong posture. The "nurse" turns, and we see THE JOKER (Nurse Disguise) — full makeup, nurse uniform stretched absurdly across his frame.

**No dialogue — horror reveal**

### Panel 13.3 — HARVEY REACTS
**Visual:** Harvey trying to rise, pulling away, but too weak. The Joker approaches with that nurse's walk, exaggerated, mocking.

**Harvey Speech:** "You... YOU!"

**Joker Speech (jagged):** "Hi there."

### Panel 13.4 — JOKER SITS
**Visual:** Joker sitting on the edge of Harvey's bed. Casual. Intimate. He's holding Harvey's scarred coin.

### Panel 13.6 — THE COIN

**Joker Speech (jagged):** "Introduce a little anarchy. You know the thing about chaos?"

### Panel 13.7 — HARVEY'S EYES
**Visual:** Close on Harvey's eyes — one normal, one exposed and bloodshot from the burn damage. Something is changing. Breaking. Or rebuilding wrong.

**Joker Speech (jagged):** "It's fair."

### Panel 13.8 — THE CORRUPTION COMPLETE
**Visual:** Harvey holding the coin up. Both sides of his face visible now — handsome and ruined. Two-Face is born.

**Harvey Speech:** "The only morality in a cruel world... is chance."

**Caption Box:** "The Joker didn't break Harvey Dent."

**Caption Box:** "He gave him permission to break himself."

---

**Location:** Gotham Harbor
**Purpose:** Courage demonstrated by others — refusing to choose on Joker's terms

### Panel 14.1 — FERRY A INTERIOR
**Visual:** Inside the civilian ferry. A group of CITIZENS staring at the detonator on the table. Fear. Anger. Desperation. One man has his hand hovering over it.

**Citizen Speech:** "We blow them up before they blow us up. It's them or us!"

### Panel 14.2 — FERRY B INTERIOR
**Visual:** Inside the prisoner ferry. The massive prisoner (TATTOOS) approaches the detonator. Guards raise weapons.

**Guard Speech:** "Put it down! PUT IT DOWN!"

### Panel 14.3 — THE PRISONER'S CHOICE

**Prisoner Speech:** "Give it to me. I'll do what you should've done ten minutes ago."

### Panel 14.4 — THE THROW

**Caption Box:** "COURAGE isn't always choosing."

### Panel 14.5 — JOKER'S DISAPPOINTMENT
**Visual:** The Joker watching monitors showing both ferries. Neither has exploded. His smile fades slightly.

**Joker Speech (jagged):** "What's wrong with these people?"

---
