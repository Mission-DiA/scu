# OPENING: THE BOARD

---

## SCENE 1: COVER
**Location:** Gotham skyline, night
**Purpose:** Establish tone, introduce chessboard motif

### Panel 1.1 — COVER IMAGE
**Visual:** Gotham skyline at night. Dark. Massive. Rain-slicked streets far below. A single chessboard sits on a rooftop ledge, pieces mid-game, lit by a single flickering streetlight. The city burns in soft orange glow behind it — multiple fires, distant chaos. A Joker playing card lies beside the board, face-up, grinning.

**Text Elements:**
- TITLE: "DECISIVE INTELLIGENCE" — white, clean sans-serif, prominent
- SUBTITLE: "The Board Is Already in Motion" — smaller, beneath title
- DI watermark: PROMINENT (bottom-left)

**Atmosphere:** Ominous anticipation. The game has already started. We're joining mid-play.

---

## SCENE 2: THE BOARD SPEAKS
**Location:** Rooftop, close on chessboard
**Purpose:** Introduce the narrator device

### Panel 2.1 — THE CHESSBOARD (CLOSE)
**Visual:** Extreme close-up of the chessboard. Pieces arranged in a complex mid-game position — neither side winning clearly. A gloved hand (Batman's) hovers above the board, not touching. Hesitation made physical. Dark blue-black palette. The Knight, Queen, Rook, and Bishop are subtly more prominent than other pieces.

**Caption Box:** "Every night in Gotham ends the same way."

### Panel 2.2 — FOUR CRISES (GHOSTLY)
**Visual:** Same chessboard, but now four ghostly overlays float above it — transparent images of four simultaneous crises. Ferry A with detonator. Ferry B with prisoners. A warehouse with Rachel tied to a chair. A warehouse with Harvey tied to a chair. Hospital in background. All semi-transparent, overlapping, creating visual chaos ABOVE the ordered board.

**Caption Box:** "With a choice you don't want to make."

---

# ACT 1: THE CHAOS

---

## SCENE 3: THE JOKER'S GAME
**Location:** Multiple Gotham locations (fragmented)
**Purpose:** Establish the four simultaneous crises — cognitive overload

### Panel 3.1 — FERRY A
**Visual:** Interior of a ferry. Civilians — families, elderly, children — huddled in fear. A DETONATOR sits on a table in the center. No one is touching it. Through the windows, another ferry is visible in the distance. Night. Water. Tension.

**No dialogue — image only**

### Panel 3.2 — FERRY B
**Visual:** Interior of the second ferry. PRISONERS in orange jumpsuits, hands cuffed, guarded by nervous SWAT officers. A matching DETONATOR sits on a table. A massive prisoner (TATTOOS, SCARS) stares at the detonator. Night. Water. Same tension, different stakes.

**No dialogue — image only**

### Panel 3.3 — WAREHOUSE A (RACHEL)
**Visual:** A dark warehouse. RACHEL DAWES tied to a chair, gasoline barrels surrounding her, a TIMER counting down (showing 4:32). She's conscious, terrified but defiant. Oil drums. Industrial decay. A phone lies on the floor nearby.

**No dialogue — image only**

### Panel 3.4 — WAREHOUSE B (HARVEY)
**Visual:** A different warehouse. HARVEY DENT tied to a chair, same setup — gasoline, timer (showing 4:28 — slightly less time), phone on floor. Half his face is pressed against a puddle of gasoline. He's struggling against the ropes. Desperate.

**No dialogue — image only**

### Panel 3.5 — FOUR CRISES (FRAGMENTED LAYOUT)
**Visual:** All four previous panels shown together in a FRAGMENTED, OVERLAPPING layout. Panels at angles, edges bleeding into each other. The visual composition itself creates cognitive overload. This is what Batman sees. This is what the Joker designed.

**Caption Box:** "The Joker doesn't want chaos."

### Panel 3.6 — THE JOKER (FIRST APPEARANCE)
**Visual:** THE JOKER (Standard) in extreme close-up. Just his face filling the panel. Smeared makeup. Glasgow scars. Those eyes — manic, calculating, delighted. He's looking directly at us.

**Joker Speech (jagged bubble):** "Tick tock, Batman."

**Caption Box:** "He wants you to create it by trying to stop it."

---

## SCENE 4: BATMAN PARALYZED
**Location:** The Batcave
**Purpose:** Show information overload leading to paralysis

### Panel 4.1 — THE BATCAVE (WIDE)
**Visual:** The Batcave — massive, dark, filled with screens. BATMAN (Pristine) stands at the center console, surrounded by monitors showing all four crises simultaneously. Police scanners, news feeds, GPS tracking, audio channels — all demanding attention. He's not moving. He's frozen.

**Caption Box:** "The problem isn't lack of information."

### Panel 4.2 — BATMAN'S EYES (CLOSE)
**Visual:** Extreme close-up on Batman's eyes through the cowl. They're moving rapidly — left, right, up, down — trying to process everything. Overwhelmed. For the first time, we see uncertainty in those eyes.

**Caption Box:** "It's too much of it."

### Panel 4.3 — THE SCREENS (DETAIL)
**Visual:** Close-up on the multiple screens. Each one showing a different crisis, a different countdown, a different demand. Text overlays, GPS coordinates, radio chatter visualized as waveforms. Pure noise.

**Radio chatter (multiple overlapping speech bubbles, small, chaotic):**
- "Ferry A reports civilian panic—"
- "Harvey Dent's tracker went dark at—"
- "Gotham General evacuation sixty percent—"
- "Rachel Dawes last seen—"

---

## SCENE 5: THE JOKER'S VOICE
**Location:** Batcave (audio intrusion)
**Purpose:** Joker's first direct communication — establishing his philosophy

### Panel 5.1 — THE JOKER'S CALL
**Visual:** Batman at the console. One screen has changed — it now shows a PHONE ICON, incoming call. All other screens still showing chaos. Batman's hand reaches for the answer button.

**No dialogue — tension**

### Panel 5.2 — JOKER ON SCREEN
**Visual:** The screen now shows THE JOKER (Standard), filming himself on a shaky handheld camera. Behind him, unclear location — could be anywhere. He's grinning. Makeup fresh. This was planned.

**Joker Speech (jagged):** "Do I really look like a guy with a plan?"

### Panel 5.3 — JOKER CONTINUES
**Visual:** Same shot, Joker leaning closer to the camera. Intimate. Conspiratorial.

**Joker Speech (jagged):** "I'm just a dog chasing cars. I wouldn't know what to do with one if I caught it."

### Panel 5.4 — JOKER'S ULTIMATUM
**Visual:** Joker pulling back, spreading his arms wide. Behind him, we now see BOTH warehouses shown on smaller screens — Rachel in one, Harvey in the other. He's showing Batman the choice.

**Joker Speech (jagged):** "You can save ONE of them. Only one. Your call, Bats."

**Joker Speech (jagged):** "Rachel... or Harvey. Tick tock."

### Panel 5.5 — BATMAN'S REACTION
**Visual:** Batman's full body in the Batcave. Shoulders tense. Fists clenched. The screens behind him show Rachel and Harvey — both timers now under 4 minutes. He's still not moving.

**Batman Internal Monologue:** "He's lying. He has to be lying. There has to be another way."

---

# ACT 2: CHOICE #1 — CLARITY

---

## SCENE 6: ALFRED'S INTERVENTION
**Location:** Batcave
**Purpose:** The Clarity moment — ruthless subtraction

### Panel 6.1 — ALFRED ENTERS
**Visual:** ALFRED PENNYWORTH (Standard) walks into frame from the right. He's carrying a tea tray — but his expression is all business. He sees the screens. He sees Batman frozen. He sets down the tray. This is not a man delivering refreshments.

**No dialogue — action**

### Panel 6.2 — ALFRED APPROACHES CONSOLE
**Visual:** Alfred walking past Batman, directly to the console. Batman doesn't stop him. Alfred's hand reaches for the screen controls. Determined.

**Alfred Speech:** "Master Wayne."

### Panel 6.3 — ALFRED ACTS
**Visual:** Alfred's hand on the console. He's TURNING OFF screens. The ferry feeds — gone. The hospital evacuation — gone. The news broadcasts — gone. He's physically removing the noise.

**Alfred Speech:** "You can't save everyone tonight."

### Panel 6.4 — TWO SCREENS REMAIN
**Visual:** Wide shot of the console. Where there were twelve screens of chaos, now only TWO remain lit. Rachel's warehouse. Harvey's warehouse. Both timers visible. The visual noise has been eliminated. The choice is now clear.

**Alfred Speech:** "But you can stop the thing that collapses everything else."

### Panel 6.5 — BATMAN'S SHOULDERS DROP
**Visual:** Close on Batman. His shoulders have dropped. He's breathing. The paralysis is breaking. He's looking at the two remaining screens with focus, not panic.

**Caption Box:** "The first step isn't more information."

### Panel 6.6 — ALFRED'S WISDOM
**Visual:** Alfred standing beside Batman, both facing the two screens. Mentor and student. The tea tray forgotten.

**Alfred Speech:** "Some men just want to watch the world burn. But you can't fight fire by running toward every flame."

**Caption Box:** "It's knowing what to ignore."

---

## SCENE 7: THE CHOICE
**Location:** Batcave
**Purpose:** Batman makes his choice — Rachel

### Panel 7.1 — TWO SCREENS (CLOSE)
**Visual:** The two screens side by side. LEFT: Rachel, timer at 3:42. RIGHT: Harvey, timer at 3:38. Both struggling. Both running out of time. The visual weight is equal. Neither screen is larger or more prominent.

**No dialogue — the visual IS the choice**

### Panel 7.2 — BATMAN'S HAND
**Visual:** Close on Batman's hand. He's pointing. At Rachel's screen. The choice is made. No dramatic gesture — just a finger pointing at what matters most to him.

**Batman Speech:** "Rachel. I'm going to Rachel."

### Panel 7.3 — ALFRED'S RESPONSE
**Visual:** Alfred's face. No judgment. No argument. Just acknowledgment. And something else — perhaps sadness, perhaps understanding. He knows what this choice means.

**Alfred Speech:** "The Joker gave you her location?"

### Panel 7.4 — BATMAN MOVES
**Visual:** Batman already turning, cape swirling, heading toward the Batmobile bay. The paralysis is gone. He's in motion.

**Batman Speech:** "250 52nd Street. I can make it."

### Panel 7.5 — ALFRED ALONE
**Visual:** Alfred standing alone at the console. The two screens still showing Rachel and Harvey. He's watching Batman leave. His expression is complex — pride, worry, and something like grief.

**Alfred Internal (caption, not speech):** "And Harvey?"

**Caption Box:** "The first choice: Know what matters most — even when everything is on fire."

---

## SCENE 8: THE RACE
**Location:** Gotham streets
**Purpose:** Transition — Batman racing to Rachel

### Panel 8.1 — BATMOBILE LAUNCHES
**Visual:** The Batmobile exploding out of the Batcave entrance, water spraying, tunnel lights blurring. Pure speed. Pure purpose.

**No dialogue — pure motion**

### Panel 8.2 — GOTHAM STREETS
**Visual:** Batmobile racing through Gotham streets. Buildings blurring past. Police cars moving aside. The city is chaos — but Batman is a straight line through it.

**Caption Box:** "Clarity shows you the board."

### Panel 8.3 — BATMAN'S FACE
**Visual:** Through the Batmobile windshield, Batman's face. Focused. Determined. No doubt. He made the choice. Now he's executing.

**Caption Box:** "What comes next asks a different question."

---

## SCENE 9: ARRIVAL
**Location:** Warehouse (wrong one)
**Purpose:** The Joker's lie revealed — Batman chose right, Joker cheated

### Panel 9.1 — WAREHOUSE EXTERIOR
**Visual:** The Batmobile screeching to a halt outside a decrepit warehouse. Address visible: 250 52nd Street. Rain falling. Darkness. Batman already exiting the vehicle.

**No dialogue — urgency**

### Panel 9.2 — BATMAN CRASHES IN
**Visual:** Batman shoulder-checking through the warehouse door. Wood splintering. Motion blur. He's moving at full speed. Timer in his head.

**No dialogue — action**

### Panel 9.3 — THE WRONG PERSON
**Visual:** Batman stops. In front of him: HARVEY DENT tied to the chair. NOT Rachel. Harvey is screaming, face pressed into the gasoline puddle, timer at 0:08. The Joker switched the addresses.

**Harvey Speech:** "RACHEL! WHERE IS SHE?!"

### Panel 9.4 — BATMAN'S REALIZATION
**Visual:** Close on Batman's face. Behind the cowl, we see it — the horror of understanding. He chose correctly. The Joker lied about which address was which. The game was rigged.

**Batman Internal:** "He lied. He—"

**Caption Box:** "Courage isn't acting with certainty."

---

# ACT 3: CHOICE #2 — COURAGE

---

## SCENE 10: THE EXPLOSION
**Location:** Both warehouses
**Purpose:** The Courage cost — Rachel dies

### Panel 10.1 — BATMAN GRABS HARVEY
**Visual:** Batman diving toward Harvey, hands ripping at the ropes. Timer at 0:03. Gasoline everywhere. Harvey's face is half-submerged in the fuel.

**No dialogue — pure action**

### Panel 10.2 — THE EXPLOSION (SPLIT)
**Visual:** Two-panel split composition. LEFT: Batman tackling Harvey through a window, fire erupting behind them. RIGHT: Rachel's warehouse exploding in a massive fireball. She never had a chance.

**Caption Box:** "It's moving forward knowing the outcome might break you."

### Panel 10.3 — AFTERMATH (HARVEY)
**Visual:** Batman and Harvey on the ground outside the warehouse. Harvey's face — the left side burned, skin blackened, eye exposed. He's screaming. Batman is trying to help, but he's looking toward the distant glow of the other explosion.

**Harvey Speech (broken, agonized):** "Rachel... RACHEL!"

### Panel 10.4 — DISTANT FIRE
**Visual:** Wide shot. Batman in the foreground, Harvey on the ground beside him. In the far background, a fireball rising — Rachel's warehouse. There was never going to be time. The choice was designed to fail.

**Caption Box:** "The second choice wasn't 'who will you save?'"

### Panel 10.5 — BATMAN'S FAILURE
**Visual:** Close on Batman's face. Rain mixing with something else. Smoke. Or tears. Behind the cowl, he's broken. He made the choice. He did everything right. And he still lost.

**Caption Box:** "It was 'will you choose at all?'"

---

## SCENE 11: INTERROGATION ROOM — FACE TO FACE #1
**Location:** GCPD Interrogation Room
**Purpose:** First direct confrontation — Joker's philosophy revealed

### Panel 11.1 — GCPD HALLWAY
**Visual:** GCPD headquarters. Chaotic. Officers rushing. In the center of the chaos, a holding cell. THE JOKER sits inside, hands cuffed to the table, completely calm while everything around him is pandemonium.

**Caption Box:** "The Joker wanted to be caught."

### Panel 11.2 — JOKER WAITING
**Visual:** Inside the interrogation room. Joker alone at the metal table, handcuffed. Single overhead light. He's not nervous. He's not worried. He's... entertained. Waiting.

**Joker Speech (jagged):** *humming* "Da da da da da..."

### Panel 11.3 — LIGHTS GO OUT
**Visual:** The room in darkness. Only the Joker's eyes visible, reflecting a tiny amount of light. He's smiling in the dark. He knows who's coming.

**Joker Speech (jagged):** "There you are."

### Panel 11.4 — BATMAN IN SHADOW
**Visual:** BATMAN (Battle-worn) emerging from the darkness. Not entering through the door — already there. How long has he been watching? The Joker doesn't flinch. He's delighted.

**Joker Speech (jagged):** "I wanted this."

### Panel 11.5 — FACE TO FACE
**Visual:** Two-shot. Batman standing over the seated Joker. Eye to eye. The Joker looking UP at Batman with that smile. Batman looking DOWN with contained fury. The power dynamic is unclear — who is really in control?

**Batman Speech:** "Where are they? Rachel and Harvey — where?"

**Joker Speech (jagged):** "Killing is making a choice."

### Panel 11.6 — JOKER'S PHILOSOPHY
**Visual:** Close on Joker's face. He's not afraid of Batman. He's studying him. Analyzing.

**Joker Speech (jagged):** "You chose not to save one of them. You made a choice. That makes you just like me."

### Panel 11.7 — BATMAN'S RESPONSE
**Visual:** Batman grabbing the Joker by the collar, lifting him from the chair. Violence barely contained.

**Batman Speech:** "I am NOTHING like you."

### Panel 11.8 — JOKER LAUGHS
**Visual:** The Joker, lifted off his feet, being slammed against the wall. And he's LAUGHING. Pure delight. This is exactly what he wanted.

**Joker Speech (jagged):** "Oh, you ARE! You just don't know it yet."

### Panel 11.9 — THE TRUTH
**Visual:** Joker's face, inches from Batman's. Intimate. Terrible.

**Joker Speech (jagged):** "I switched the addresses. You went to save Rachel. You saved Harvey. I didn't choose who lived, Batman."

**Joker Speech (jagged):** "You did."

---

## SCENE 12: THE FERRY GAMBIT
**Location:** Gotham Harbor
**Purpose:** Courage demonstrated by others — the ferry dilemma resolved

### Panel 12.1 — FERRY A INTERIOR
**Visual:** Inside the civilian ferry. A group of CITIZENS staring at the detonator on the table. Fear. Anger. Desperation. One man has his hand hovering over it. A woman is crying. A child is watching.

**Citizen Speech:** "We blow them up before they blow us up. It's them or us!"

### Panel 12.2 — FERRY B INTERIOR
**Visual:** Inside the prisoner ferry. The massive prisoner (TATTOOS) approaches the table where the detonator sits. Guards raise weapons. Other prisoners back away. He picks up the detonator.

**Guard Speech:** "Put it down! PUT IT DOWN!"

### Panel 12.3 — THE PRISONER'S CHOICE
**Visual:** Close on the prisoner's hands. Massive, scarred, tattooed. Holding the small detonator. He turns to face the guard.

**Prisoner Speech:** "Give it to me. I'll do what you should've done ten minutes ago."

### Panel 12.4 — THE THROW
**Visual:** The prisoner's arm extended. The detonator flying through a broken window. Splash in the dark water below. Everyone on the ferry staring in shock.

**Caption Box:** "Courage isn't always choosing."

### Panel 12.5 — JOKER'S DISAPPOINTMENT
**Visual:** Cut to: The Joker, now watching multiple monitors showing both ferries. Neither has exploded. His smile fades slightly. This part of his plan has failed.

**Joker Speech (jagged):** "What's wrong with these people?"

**Caption Box:** "Sometimes it's refusing to choose on someone else's terms."

---

## SCENE 13: HARVEY'S HOSPITAL — FACE TO FACE #2
**Location:** Gotham General Hospital
**Purpose:** Joker corrupts Harvey — creates Two-Face

### Panel 13.1 — HOSPITAL ROOM
**Visual:** Hospital room. HARVEY DENT lies in bed, half his face bandaged (we know what's underneath). He's broken. Hollow. Staring at the ceiling.

**No dialogue — devastation**

### Panel 13.2 — NURSE ENTERS
**Visual:** A NURSE enters the room. Something's wrong with the silhouette. Too tall. Wrong posture. The "nurse" turns, and we see THE JOKER (Nurse Disguise) — full makeup, nurse uniform stretched absurdly across his frame, name tag reading "NURSE."

**No dialogue — horror reveal**

### Panel 13.3 — HARVEY REACTS
**Visual:** Harvey trying to rise, pulling away, but too weak. The Joker approaches the bed with that nurse's walk, exaggerated, mocking.

**Harvey Speech:** "You... YOU!"

**Joker Speech (jagged):** "Hi there."

### Panel 13.4 — JOKER SITS
**Visual:** Joker sitting on the edge of Harvey's bed. Casual. Intimate. Like a friend visiting the sick. He's holding Harvey's scarred coin — the one that was in Harvey's pocket during the explosion.

**Joker Speech (jagged):** "I'm not a monster. I'm just ahead of the curve."

### Panel 13.5 — THE PHILOSOPHY
**Visual:** Close two-shot. Joker leaning in toward Harvey's bandaged face. Conspiratorial.

**Joker Speech (jagged):** "You know what I noticed? Nobody panics when things go according to plan. Even if the plan is horrifying."

**Joker Speech (jagged):** "Upset the established order, and everything becomes chaos."

### Panel 13.6 — THE COIN
**Visual:** Joker pressing the coin into Harvey's hand. One side clean, one side scarred by the explosion — like Harvey himself.

**Joker Speech (jagged):** "Introduce a little anarchy. You know the thing about chaos?"

### Panel 13.7 — HARVEY'S EYES
**Visual:** Close on Harvey's eyes — one normal, one exposed and bloodshot from the burn damage. Something is changing. Breaking. Or rebuilding wrong.

**Joker Speech (jagged):** "It's fair."

### Panel 13.8 — THE CORRUPTION COMPLETE
**Visual:** Harvey holding the coin up. Looking at it. Both sides of his face visible now — handsome and ruined. The bandages have been pulled away. Two-Face is born.

**Harvey Speech:** "The only morality in a cruel world... is chance."

**Caption Box:** "The Joker didn't break Harvey Dent."

**Caption Box:** "He just gave him permission to break himself."

---

## SCENE 14: THE FERRY FINALE
**Location:** Gotham Harbor
**Purpose:** Batman defeats Joker's plan — but at what cost?

### Panel 14.1 — JOKER'S POSITION
**Visual:** The Joker standing in an unfinished high-rise building. Construction site. Open floors, exposed beams. He's holding a detonator — the REAL one, connected to BOTH ferries. Below him, SWAT teams and attack dogs are searching lower floors.

**No dialogue — Joker waiting**

### Panel 14.2 — BATMAN ARRIVES
**Visual:** Batman landing on the same floor. Emerging from darkness. The two face each other across the construction floor. Final confrontation.

**Joker Speech (jagged):** "You made it. I'm touched."

### Panel 14.3 — JOKER'S ULTIMATUM
**Visual:** Joker holding up the detonator. Finger hovering over the button.

**Joker Speech (jagged):** "The ferries won't do it. They disappointed me. But you? You never disappoint."

**Joker Speech (jagged):** "Hit me. Just once. I'll push this button and we'll see who the real monster is."

### Panel 14.4 — BATMAN'S CHOICE
**Visual:** Batman's hand. Bat-shaped throwing blades visible between his fingers. He's choosing his weapon. But not to kill — to disarm.

**Caption Box:** "The third choice was already forming."

### Panel 14.5 — THE THROW
**Visual:** Motion blur — bat-blades flying. Striking Joker's hand. The detonator flying free. Joker's hand bleeding. Batman already moving, closing the distance.

**No dialogue — precision violence**

### Panel 14.6 — JOKER FALLS
**Visual:** Batman tackling Joker. Both going over the edge of the building. Falling. Joker's coat flapping like wings. He's LAUGHING as they fall.

**Joker Speech (jagged):** "HAHAHAHA!"

### Panel 14.7 — CAUGHT
**Visual:** Batman's grappling hook fired. Both men jerked to a stop. Joker dangling upside down from Batman's grip. The city below them. Joker still laughing.

**Joker Speech (jagged):** "You won't kill me out of some misplaced sense of self-righteousness. And I won't kill you because you're just too much FUN."

### Panel 14.8 — JOKER'S FINAL TRUTH
**Visual:** Joker dangling, face-to-face with Batman who holds the line. Intimate. Both exhausted. Both knowing something has changed forever.

**Joker Speech (jagged):** "I think you and I are destined to do this forever."

### Panel 14.9 — JOKER'S VICTORY
**Visual:** Joker's smile. He's lost the ferry gambit. He's captured. But he's smiling like he won.

**Joker Speech (jagged):** "Oh, and by the way... I took care of the other problem."

**Joker Speech (jagged):** "Harvey. I had a little chat with him."

---

# ACT 4: CHOICE #3 — COMMITMENT

**Location:** Warehouse (Harvey's choice)
**Purpose:** See what Harvey has become — the symbol corrupted

### Panel 15.1 — WAREHOUSE EXTERIOR
**Visual:** A different warehouse. Night. GORDON's car pulling up. He's been called here. He doesn't know why. Rain falling.

**No dialogue — tension**

### Panel 15.2 — GORDON ENTERS
**Visual:** JIM GORDON (Standard) entering the warehouse, gun drawn. Flashlight sweeping. Empty. Or so it seems.

**Gordon Speech:** "Hello? This is Commissioner Gordon. Identify yourself."

### Panel 15.3 — TWO-FACE IN SHADOW
**Visual:** In the shadows, a figure. Half-lit. We see one side — Harvey's handsome profile. The other side is darkness.

**Two-Face Speech:** "Hello, Jim."

### Panel 15.4 — GORDON'S HORROR
**Visual:** Gordon's face. Recognition. Then horror. His friend. His ally. The man who was supposed to save Gotham.

**Gordon Speech:** "Harvey... Harvey, what happened to you?"

### Panel 15.5 — TWO-FACE REVEALED (FULL)
**Visual:** TWO-FACE steps into full light. Both sides of his face visible. The handsome DA. The burned horror. He's holding the coin in one hand, a gun in the other.

**Two-Face Speech:** "The same thing that happens to everyone, Jim. The world showed me its true face."

### Panel 15.6 — THE COIN
**Visual:** Close on the coin in Two-Face's fingers. Clean side. Scarred side. He's flipping it, catching it.

**Two-Face Speech:** "And I learned something. The only way to live in a cruel world... is to become cruel yourself."

---

## SCENE 16: GORDON'S FAMILY
**Location:** Warehouse
**Purpose:** Two-Face threatens Gordon's son — Commitment demanded

### Panel 16.1 — THE THREAT
**Visual:** Two-Face gestures. From the shadows, TWO CORRUPT COPS push forward GORDON'S SON (young boy, 8, terrified) and GORDON'S WIFE (blindfolded). Gordon's gun lowers. He can't shoot.

**Gordon Speech:** "Harvey, no. They have nothing to do with this."

### Panel 16.2 — TWO-FACE'S LOGIC
**Visual:** Two-Face crouching to eye level with Gordon's son. The boy staring at the burned face with terror. Two-Face's voice is calm, reasonable.

**Two-Face Speech:** "It's not about what they did, Jim. It's about what's FAIR."

**Two-Face Speech:** "You couldn't save Rachel. Your system couldn't protect Harvey Dent. So someone has to pay the price."

### Panel 16.3 — THE GUN RISES
**Visual:** Two-Face pressing the gun to the boy's head. Gordon on his knees. Begging.

**Gordon Speech:** "HARVEY, PLEASE!"

### Panel 16.4 — THE COIN FLIP
**Visual:** Two-Face flipping the coin. Everyone frozen. The coin spinning in the air. Everything depends on how it lands.

**Two-Face Speech:** "Heads, he lives. Tails..."

**Caption Box:** "The third choice wasn't about saving Gordon's son."

### Panel 16.5 — BATMAN ARRIVES
**Visual:** Shadow falling across Two-Face. He looks up. Batman on a beam above. Watching. Calculating.

**No dialogue — arrival**

### Panel 16.6 — THREE-WAY STANDOFF
**Visual:** Wide shot. Two-Face with gun to the boy. Gordon on his knees. Batman in the shadows. Three men. One terrible equation.

**Caption Box:** "It was about what you're willing to destroy to protect what matters."

---

## SCENE 17: THE TACKLE
**Location:** Warehouse
**Purpose:** Batman makes the Commitment choice — destroys Harvey to save the child

### Panel 17.1 — BATMAN'S VOICE
**Visual:** Batman stepping forward. Hands visible. No weapons. He's trying to talk Two-Face down.

**Batman Speech:** "Harvey. This isn't who you are."

**Two-Face Speech:** "This is EXACTLY who I am. Who I always was. The coin just... revealed it."

### Panel 17.2 — HARVEY'S PAIN
**Visual:** Close on Two-Face's face. Both sides. The burned eye is weeping — tears or damaged tear ducts, unclear. There's pain under the madness.

**Two-Face Speech:** "I loved her, Bruce."

### Panel 17.3 — BATMAN'S RECOGNITION
**Visual:** Batman's reaction. Harvey used his real name. They both know who's under the mask. The final pretense is gone.

**Batman Speech:** "I know. I loved her too."

### Panel 17.4 — THE COIN (AIR)
**Visual:** The coin flipping again. Everyone frozen.

**Two-Face Speech:** "Then you understand. Someone has to pay."

### Panel 17.5 — BATMAN MOVES
**Visual:** Motion blur — Batman lunging. Not at the gun. At HARVEY. Full body tackle. They're both going to go over the edge.

**Caption Box:** "Commitment means accepting the cost before you see the outcome."

### Panel 17.6 — THE FALL
**Visual:** Batman and Two-Face falling from the building. Gordon grabbing his son. The coin falling separately. Three trajectories.

**No dialogue — motion**

### Panel 17.7 — THE LANDING
**Visual:** Ground level. Harvey lands first. Hard. Wrong angle. Batman lands beside him, grappling line slowing his fall. Harvey isn't moving.

**Caption Box:** "The third choice: Know that some victories cost you everything you were trying to protect."

---

## SCENE 18: THE BODY
**Location:** Warehouse ground level
**Purpose:** Harvey is dead — Gotham's symbol destroyed

### Panel 18.1 — GORDON ARRIVES

**Gordon Speech:** "Is he...?"

### Panel 18.2 — BATMAN'S CONFIRMATION
**Visual:** Batman standing. Looking down at Harvey. The man who was supposed to be Gotham's savior. Now just a body. A failed experiment.

**Batman Speech:** "He's gone."

### Panel 18.3 — THE COIN (GROUND)
**Visual:** Close on Harvey's hand. The coin visible. It landed scarred side up.

**Caption Box:** "Harvey Dent died thinking the world was cruel."

### Panel 18.4 — GORDON'S GRIEF
**Visual:** Gordon kneeling beside Harvey. His friend. His ally. The man they all believed in. Now just another body in Gotham.

**Gordon Speech:** "Now he's this."

---

## SCENE 19: THE FOURTH CHOICE FORMS
**Location:** Warehouse, beside Harvey's body
**Purpose:** Transition to final choice — Movement

### Panel 19.1 — BATMAN'S REALIZATION
**Visual:** Batman looking at Harvey's body. Then at Gordon. Then at the city beyond the warehouse. Something is forming. A decision.

**Batman Internal:** "If Gotham knows what Harvey became... everything he built falls apart."

### Panel 19.2 — THE DENT ACT
**Visual:** Quick flash — newspaper headlines, Harvey Dent campaign posters, "I believe in Harvey Dent" signs. All the hope he represented.

**Caption Box:** "Harvey Dent wasn't just a man."

### Panel 19.3 — GOTHAM'S HOPE
**Visual:** Another quick flash — criminals being arrested under the "Dent Act." The mob in retreat. Gotham actually getting safer. All because people believed in Harvey.

**Caption Box:** "He was proof that the system could work."

### Panel 19.4 — BATMAN'S FACE
**Visual:** Back to present. Batman's face through the cowl. He knows what he has to do.

**Caption Box:** "And now he was proof that it couldn't."

**Caption Box:** "Unless someone else took the fall."

# ACT 5: CHOICE #4 — MOVEMENT

## SCENE 20: THE LIE
**Location:** Warehouse
**Purpose:** Batman decides to take the blame — Movement initiated

### Panel 20.1 — BATMAN SPEAKS
**Visual:** Batman and Gordon face to face. Gordon still on his knees beside Harvey. Batman's voice is calm. Certain.

**Gordon Speech:** "Then what do we do? Five people are dead — Harvey's victims. Someone has to answer for them."

**Batman Speech:** "Someone will."

### Panel 20.3 — GORDON'S CONFUSION

**Gordon Speech:** "Who? We can't blame the Joker — he was in custody when—"

**Visual:** Batman's hand on Gordon's shoulder. The answer is in the gesture.

**Batman Speech:** "Pin it on me."

### Panel 20.5 — GORDON'S REACTION

**Gordon Speech:** "No. You can't — you're the only reason this city—"

### Panel 20.6 — BATMAN'S LOGIC
**Visual:** Batman helping Gordon to his feet. Both standing. Face to face.

**Batman Speech:** "Harvey was the hero you could believe in. I'm the hero you can blame."

**Batman Speech:** "The Dent Act survives. The criminals stay locked up. Gotham keeps its hope."

### Panel 20.7 — GORDON'S ACCEPTANCE
**Visual:** Gordon's face. He hates this. But he sees the logic. He takes a breath.

**Gordon Speech:** "You'll be hunted. By everyone. By me."

### Panel 20.8 — BATMAN'S COMMITMENT

**Batman Speech:** "I know."

**Caption Box:** "The fourth choice: Make the move that locks you in."

**Purpose:** Movement in action — the system turns against Batman

### Panel 21.1 — GORDON'S ORDER
**Visual:** Gordon at a police radio. His face is stone. He's doing what he has to do.

### Panel 21.3 — BATMAN RUNNING

**Caption Box:** "Movement isn't just action."

### Panel 21.4 — SPOTLIGHTS

**No dialogue — weight of the moment**

### Panel 22.2 — GORDON'S SON
**Visual:** Gordon's son watches from the rooftop access door. Confused. The man his father just said was a murderer saved his life.

**Gordon's Son Speech:** "Dad... he saved me. Why are we hunting him?"

### Panel 22.3 — GORDON'S ANSWER
**Visual:** Gordon looking at his son. Then at the Bat-Signal. The axe heavy in his hands.

**Gordon Speech:** "Because he's the hero Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now."

### Panel 22.4 — THE AXE RAISED

**Caption Box:** "The fourth choice wasn't about sacrifice."

### Panel 23.2 — BATMAN'S BACK

### Panel 24.5 — THE CHAIN

**Location:** Abstract / Rooftop
**Purpose:** The game resolved — but at what cost?

### Panel 25.1 — THE BOARD (WIDE)
**Visual:** The chessboard from the opening. Same rooftop. Same rain. But now the game is different. Batman's piece (Black Knight) stands alone in the center.

**No dialogue — visual only**

**Caption Box:** "The city survived. But nothing is the same."

---

## SCENE 26: JOKER'S FINAL WORD — FACE TO FACE #4
**Location:** Arkham Asylum
**Purpose:** Joker's lingering victory — the last laugh

**Visual:** Arkham Asylum exterior. Gothic. Forbidding. Dawn light touching the spires.

**No dialogue — establishing**

### Panel 26.2 — JOKER'S CELL

**No dialogue — waiting**

### Panel 26.3 — SHADOW AT THE WINDOW

**Joker Speech (jagged):** "I knew you'd visit."

### Panel 26.4 — BATMAN (SHADOW ONLY)
**Visual:** We don't see Batman directly — just his silhouette against the barred window. The Joker seeing what we can't see clearly.

**Batman Speech:** "It's over."

### Panel 26.5 — JOKER'S SMILE
**Visual:** Close on Joker's face. That smile. Even in defeat, even captured, even locked away — he's smiling.

**Joker Speech (jagged):** "Oh, it's never over."

**Visual:** Joker leaning forward, eyes bright with mad intelligence.

**Joker Speech (jagged):** "Madness, as you know, is like gravity."

**Joker Speech (jagged, small):** "Ha. Ha. Ha."

---

## SCENE 27: THE BLACK PAGE
**Location:** N/A
**Purpose:** Episode close — the hanging question

### Panel 27.1 — BLACK PAGE
**Visual:** Pure black. Nothing else. No texture, no gradient. Just black.

**Text (centered, white):** "The board is already in motion."

**DI Watermark:** PROMINENT (bottom-left, white with gold outline)

---

## SCENE 28: POST-CREDITS TEASE
**Location:** The Batcave (8 years later)
**Purpose:** Plant the seed for Episode 3

### Panel 28.1 — BATCAVE (DUSTY)
**Visual:** The Batcave, but different. Dusty. Dark. The Batsuit visible on its stand, covered in a sheet. Equipment powered down. It's been YEARS since this place was active.

**Caption Box:** "Eight years later..."

### Panel 28.2 — THE COMPLETED BOARD

**Caption Box:** "The board remained."
