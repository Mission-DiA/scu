# OPENING: FALSE PEACE

---

## SCENE 1: COVER
**Location:** Gotham skyline, day — peaceful
**Purpose:** Establish the false peace, time jump

### Panel 1.1 — COVER IMAGE
**Visual:** Gotham skyline in DAYLIGHT — unusual for this trilogy. Clean streets. Rebuilt buildings. The city looks healed. But on a rooftop ledge, a chessboard sits — the same one from EP1 and EP2. The four pieces (Knight blue, Queen red, Rook white, Bishop orange) stand proud. But dust covers them. Unused. Forgotten.

**Text Elements:**
- TITLE: "DECISIVE INTELLIGENCE" — white, clean sans-serif, prominent
- SUBTITLE: "The Adaptation" — smaller, beneath title
- EPISODE: "Episode 3" — smallest
- SMALL TEXT: "Eight years later..."

**Atmosphere:** Peace. But something's wrong. The framework sits unused. Rust forming.

---

## SCENE 2: THE RECLUSE
**Location:** Wayne Manor (rebuilt), interior
**Purpose:** Show Bruce's retreat from the framework

### Panel 2.1 — EMPTY HALLS
**Visual:** Wayne Manor interior — grand but hollow. Dust motes in sunlight. Empty rooms. No one living here, just existing.

**Caption Box:** "Eight years since the Joker."

### Panel 2.2 — BRUCE (RECLUSE)
**Visual:** Bruce Wayne, older, beard unkempt, using a cane. Standing at a window, looking out at nothing. He's not broken — he's stopped. The framework sits dormant.

**Caption Box:** "Eight years since Batman took the fall."

### Panel 2.3 — ALFRED'S CONCERN
**Visual:** Alfred in doorway, watching Bruce with deep concern. Tea tray in hands, untouched from yesterday. The distance between them visible.

**Alfred Speech:** "You're not living, sir. You're waiting to die."

### Panel 2.4 — THE CANE
**Visual:** Close on Bruce's hand gripping the cane. His knuckles white. The injuries from EP2 never fully healed — because he stopped fighting.

**Caption Box:** "Victory had defeated him."

### Panel 2.5 — GOTHAM THROUGH WINDOW
**Visual:** Through the window — Gotham in the distance. Peaceful. Orderly. The lie from EP2 worked. Harvey Dent's legacy held.

**Caption Box:** "The lie had held. Gotham was at peace."

### Panel 2.6 — BUT SOMETHING STIRS
**Visual:** Deep underground — a sewer tunnel. Darkness. The first glimpse of MOVEMENT in the shadows. Something massive. A breathing sound implied.

**Caption Box:** "But peace has a cost. And someone had come to collect."

---

# ACT 1: THE RECKONING

---

## SCENE 3: BANE ARRIVES
**Location:** Gotham streets / underground
**Purpose:** Introduce Bane — FORCE, not chaos

### Panel 3.1 — THE UNDERGROUND ARMY
**Visual:** Gotham's sewers, transformed. An ARMY of mercenaries, organized, disciplined. Not chaos like the Joker — ORDER. Military precision.

**Caption Box:** "The Joker brought chaos. This was something else."

### Panel 3.2 — BANE'S BACK
**Visual:** A massive figure from behind — BANE. Enormous shoulders, shaved head, the mask visible at the edges. He stands before a map of Gotham.

**Caption Box:** "This was reckoning."

### Panel 3.3 — BANE TURNS
**Visual:** Bane turns to face camera. Full reveal. The mask. The eyes above it — cold, calculating, patient. He's been waiting.

**Bane Speech:** "Gotham... take control of your city."

### Panel 3.4 — THE STOCK EXCHANGE
**Visual:** Exterior of Gotham Stock Exchange. Bane's men in motorcycle helmets, armed, entering in broad daylight. No masks. No games. Just force.

**Caption Box:** "He didn't hide. He didn't play games."

### Panel 3.5 — BANE WALKING THROUGH
**Visual:** Bane walking through the stock exchange floor, traders cowering. He's not running. Not hurrying. Just walking. Inevitable.

**Bane Speech:** "There's no money here for you to steal."

**Bane Speech:** "Really? Then why are you people here?"

---

## SCENE 4: BATMAN RETURNS (UNPREPARED)
**Location:** Gotham streets, night
**Purpose:** Show Batman's first appearance — rusty, unprepared

### Panel 4.1 — THE BAT-POD
**Visual:** The Bat-Pod roars through Gotham streets — first time in eight years. Police chase Bane's men. And then HE appears.

**Caption Box:** "Eight years. No training. No readiness."

### Panel 4.2 — BATMAN ON THE POD
**Visual:** Batman on the Bat-Pod — but something's different. The suit is the same, but the man inside is slower. Rusty. He's relying on memory, not skill.

**Caption Box:** "But Gotham needed Batman."

### Panel 4.3 — GORDON SEES
**Visual:** Gordon (older, using a cane himself) watching from a rooftop. Seeing the Bat-Signal light up for the first time in eight years. His face — hope mixed with fear.

**Gordon Speech (whisper):** "He came back."

### Panel 4.4 — BANE WATCHES
**Visual:** Bane in shadow, watching Batman's return on a screen. He's not surprised. He's not worried. He's... satisfied.

**Bane Speech:** "So... the Batman has returned."

**Bane Speech:** "Let him."

---

## SCENE 5: THE WARNING
**Location:** Batcave
**Purpose:** Alfred's warning — the framework requires maintenance

### Panel 5.1 — BATCAVE (DUSTY)
**Visual:** The Batcave — covered in dust. Computers dark. The Batsuit in its case, pristine but untouched. A museum, not a command center.

**Caption Box:** "The tools had waited. But tools need wielders."

### Panel 5.2 — BRUCE REMOVES THE COWL
**Visual:** Bruce pulling off the cowl, exhausted after his first night back. His face shows the cost — he's breathing hard. This should have been easy.

**Caption Box:** "Eight years ago, this would have been a warm-up."

### Panel 5.3 — ALFRED'S WARNING
**Visual:** Alfred approaching, fear in his eyes. He's seen Bruce injured before. This is different.

**Alfred Speech:** "You haven't been training, sir. You're not ready."

### Panel 5.4 — BRUCE'S DEFIANCE
**Visual:** Bruce looking at Alfred, jaw set. Stubborn. The same stubbornness that built Batman — now working against him.

**Bruce Speech:** "Gotham needs Batman."

**Alfred Speech:** "But does Batman need to be you? Or just... alive?"

### Panel 5.5 — THE MEDICAL SCAN
**Visual:** A medical scan on screen — Bruce's body. Damaged knees. Scar tissue. Deteriorated cartilage. The physical cost of EP1 and EP2 laid bare.

**Caption Box:** "Peace has cost you your strength."

### Panel 5.6 — ALFRED'S LAST PLEA
**Visual:** Alfred, tears in his eyes, gripping Bruce's arm.

**Alfred Speech:** "I've buried enough Waynes, sir."

**Bruce Speech:** "You won't bury this one."

---

## SCENE 6: BANE'S PHILOSOPHY
**Location:** Bane's underground lair
**Purpose:** Establish Bane's worldview — direct counter to the framework

### Panel 6.1 — BANE ADDRESSES HIS ARMY
**Visual:** Bane standing before his mercenaries. Not a speech of chaos like the Joker — a speech of PURPOSE. Order through destruction.

**Bane Speech:** "Gotham's reckoning is coming."

### Panel 6.2 — THE LEAGUE OF SHADOWS SYMBOL
**Visual:** Close on Bane's tactical vest — a subtle symbol. The League of Shadows. Ra's Al Ghul's legacy. This connects to EP1.

**Caption Box:** "Ra's wanted to destroy Gotham."
**Caption Box:** "Bane would finish what Ra's started."

### Panel 6.3 — BANE'S MASK (CLOSE)
**Visual:** Extreme close-up of Bane's mask. The breathing apparatus. The tubes. The mechanical breathing sound implied.

**Caption Box:** "But where Ra's used ideology and the Joker used chaos..."

### Panel 6.4 — BANE'S FIST
**Visual:** Bane's fist — massive, scarred, clenched. Pure force.

**Caption Box:** "Bane used force."

### Panel 6.5 — "I AM GOTHAM'S RECKONING"
**Visual:** Bane looking directly at camera. Eyes cold above the mask.

**Bane Speech:** "I am Gotham's reckoning."

---

## SCENE 7: THE CONFRONTATION
**Location:** Underground sewer lair
**Purpose:** The first fight — Batman's framework fails against force

### Panel 7.1 — BATMAN DESCENDS
**Visual:** Batman descending into Bane's lair. Dark. Water dripping. He thinks he's hunting. He's being led.

**Caption Box:** "He thought the framework still worked."

### Panel 7.2 — BANE WAITING
**Visual:** Bane standing in the center of a concrete arena, lit from above. Arms clasped behind his back. Waiting. Patient.

**Bane Speech:** "Ah, you think darkness is your ally."

### Panel 7.3 — "I WAS BORN IN IT"
**Visual:** Bane stepping forward, eyes locked on Batman.

**Bane Speech:** "You merely adopted the dark. I was born in it, molded by it. I didn't see the light until I was already a man."

### Panel 7.4 — THE FRAMEWORK FAILS (CLARITY)
**Visual:** Batman's analytical gaze — trying to find weakness, pattern, angle. But Bane has none. He's not hiding anything. There's no puzzle to solve.

**Caption Box (BLUE #4A90D9):** "CLARITY — find what matters."
**Caption Box:** "But Bane wasn't hiding anything."

### Panel 7.5 — THE FRAMEWORK FAILS (COURAGE)
**Visual:** Batman throws the first punch. Bane catches it. Effortlessly. Batman's eyes widen in the cowl.

**Caption Box (RED #EF4444):** "COURAGE — act without certainty."
**Caption Box:** "Action without preparation is suicide."

### Panel 7.6 — THE FRAMEWORK FAILS (COMMITMENT)
**Visual:** Batman committed to the fight — but his body fails. A kick that should have landed, blocked. A move that should have worked, countered.

**Caption Box (WHITE #FFFFFF):** "COMMITMENT — remove the safety net."
**Caption Box:** "He had no safety net. He had no strength."

---

## SCENE 8: THE BREAKING
**Location:** Underground sewer lair
**Purpose:** Bane breaks Batman — physical and psychological

### Panel 8.1 — BANE DOMINATES
**Visual:** Bane punishing Batman — blow after blow. Not fast. Not rushed. Methodical. Breaking him piece by piece.

**Bane Speech:** "Victory has defeated you."

### Panel 8.2 — BATMAN DOWN
**Visual:** Batman on his knees, cowl cracked, blood visible. He's trying to rise. He can't.

**Bane Speech:** "Peace has cost you your strength."

### Panel 8.3 — "I WILL BREAK YOU"
**Visual:** Bane lifting Batman overhead. The most iconic image of the film. About to break his back.

**Bane Speech:** "I will break you."

### Panel 8.4 — THE BREAK
**Visual:** The impact. Batman across Bane's knee. His back broken. The sound implied — devastating.

**No dialogue. No caption. Just the image.**

### Panel 8.5 — BROKEN ON THE GROUND
**Visual:** Batman crumpled on the ground. Cowl half-off. Bruce's face visible — eyes open, body unmoving. Broken.

**Caption Box (ORANGE #F97316):** "MOVEMENT — create irreversibility."
**Caption Box:** "Bane created it for him."

### Panel 8.6 — BANE STANDS OVER HIM
**Visual:** Bane standing over Bruce's broken body. Not gloating. Not laughing like the Joker would. Just... done.

**Bane Speech:** "When Gotham is ashes, you have my permission to die."

---

# ACT 3: THE PIT

---

## SCENE 9: THE PRISON
**Location:** The Pit — underground prison
**Purpose:** Bruce confronts his failure — the framework shattered

### Panel 9.1 — THE PIT (WIDE)
**Visual:** Looking UP from the bottom of the Pit. Stone walls rising impossibly high. A small circle of light far above. Prisoners watching from cells carved into walls.

**Caption Box:** "Bane didn't kill him. He sent him somewhere worse."

### Panel 9.2 — BRUCE ON THE COT
**Visual:** Bruce lying on a cot, back brace holding him together. Eyes staring at the light above. Defeated.

**Caption Box:** "The Pit. A prison with no guards."

### Panel 9.3 — THE BLIND PRISONER
**Visual:** An old prisoner, blind, tending to Bruce. The prison's doctor. He's seen many try to escape. He's seen all of them fail.

**Blind Prisoner Speech:** "You will climb. Everyone tries. No one escapes."

### Panel 9.4 — THE CHESSBOARD (REMEMBERED)
**Visual:** Bruce's mind — remembering the chessboard. The four pieces. But now they're SHATTERED. Broken on the ground. The framework destroyed.

**Caption Box:** "The Joker tested it."
**Caption Box:** "Bane destroyed it."

### Panel 9.5 — GOTHAM BURNS (TV STATIC)

**Bruce Speech:** "I fear Gotham dying. I fear failing."

### Panel 10.3 — "THAT IS NOT THE SAME"
**Visual:** Close on the blind prisoner's face — sightless eyes that see everything.

**Blind Prisoner Speech:** "Fear of failure is not fear of death. One makes you reckless. The other makes you climb."

### Panel 10.4 — BRUCE SEES THE TRUTH
**Visual:** Bruce staring at the light above. Finally seeing.

**Caption Box (BLUE #4A90D9):** "CLARITY redefined:"
**Caption Box:** "The framework failed because HE failed."

### Panel 10.5 — FLASHBACK: RA'S
**Visual:** Quick flash — Ra's Al Ghul from EP1, training Bruce. Semi-transparent overlay.

**Caption Box:** "Ra's taught the framework. But Bruce had stopped training. Stopped preparing. Stopped acting."

---

## SCENE 11: REBUILDING COURAGE
**Location:** The Pit
**Purpose:** COURAGE redefined — the fear of death enables

**Caption Box (RED #EF4444):** "COURAGE — act without certainty."

### Panel 11.2 — THE FALL

**Prisoners (chanting):** "Deshi basara! Deshi basara!"

**Visual:** Bruce on the cot again, defeated. The blind prisoner beside him.

**Bruce Speech:** "Why can't I make the jump?"

### Panel 11.4 — "THE ROPE"
**Visual:** The blind prisoner pointing to the rope attached to Bruce's waist.

**Blind Prisoner Speech:** "The rope. The safety net."

**Bruce Speech:** "The rope saves me if I fall."

**Blind Prisoner Speech:** "And that is why you fall."

### Panel 11.5 — COURAGE REQUIRES FEAR
**Visual:** Close on Bruce's face, understanding dawning.

**Blind Prisoner Speech:** "Fear of death is not weakness. Fear of death is what makes you CLIMB. Without it, you do not care if you reach the top."

**Caption Box (RED #EF4444):** "COURAGE redefined:"
**Caption Box:** "Not the absence of fear. The presence of it."
**Caption Box:** "Remove the safety net. Then you'll find the will to succeed."

**Prisoners (chanting):** "Deshi basara! Deshi basara!"

**Caption Box (WHITE #FFFFFF):** "COMMITMENT redefined:"

**Visual:** Bruce's hands catching the ledge. Holding. Pulling up.

**Prisoners (chanting):** "DESHI BASARA!"

### Panel 13.6 — MOVEMENT REDEFINED
**Visual:** Close on the Bat-Signal on the map.

**Caption Box (ORANGE #F97316):** "MOVEMENT redefined:"

**Caption Box:** "Decisive Intelligence is a discipline, not a moment."

### Panel 22.3 — BATMAN'S SILHOUETTE

**Caption Box:** "Learn the framework."
**Caption Box:** "Test it against chaos."
**Caption Box:** "Adapt it against force."

### Panel 22.4 — THE BOARD RESTS

**Caption Box:** "And someone else has been watching."

## SCENE 24: DOCTOR DOOM (UNMASKED)
**Location:** Through the portal
**Purpose:** RDJ reveal — full face, the audience sees him

### Panel 24.1 — DOOM STEPS THROUGH
**Visual:** A figure stepping through the portal. Boots first. Heavy. Armored. A flowing green cloak.

**Caption Box:** "He's faced gods. Outsmarted empires. Ruled nations."

### Panel 24.2 — DOOM'S FACE (RDJ REVEAL)
**Visual:** Doctor Doom's face — UNMASKED. Robert Downey Jr., older, salt-and-pepper goatee, knowing smirk. Holding the Doom mask in one hand. Looking directly at the viewer.

**Caption Box:** "Now he's interested in YOUR framework."

### Panel 24.3 — THE SMIRK
**Visual:** Close on RDJ's face as Doom. That familiar smirk — but colder. More dangerous. This isn't Tony Stark.

**Doom Speech:** "Three villains couldn't break it."

### Panel 24.4 — HE RAISES THE MASK

**Doom Speech:** "But this time..."

### Panel 25.3 — DOOM'S EYES (THROUGH MASK)
