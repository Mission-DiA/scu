## SLIDE 00: COVER

```
Create a FULL BLEED digital comic cover in Dark Knight noir photorealistic style at 16:9 aspect ratio (1920x1080px). The image must extend to ALL EDGES with NO margins, borders, or frames.

SCENE: The Batcave, calm and blue-lit. A chessboard with clearly arranged pieces sits on a stone table — four key pieces prominent, each spotlit in a distinct color.

LAYOUT: Single panel filling entire frame.

---

=== DI × SCU BRANDING — PROMINENT (COVER SLIDE) ===

WATERMARK:
• Text: "DI × SCU"
• Position: Bottom-left corner, approximately 20 pixels from edges
• Color: Dark grey (#333333) with subtle gold (#D4A843) outline
• Size: 3% of image width
• Opacity: Clearly visible, part of the design

TITLE TEXT:
• "DECISIVE INTELLIGENCE: TAKEAWAY PLAYBOOK" — White (#FFFFFF), clean sans-serif, large, upper-center area
• "What Batman Teaches About Deciding Under Fire" — White (#FFFFFF), smaller, beneath title, italicized

=== DARK KNIGHT PALETTE ===
• Primary tint: Deep blue-black (#0A1628) with calm blue (#3B82F6) ambient
• Environment: Batcave interior, ordered, post-Prologue calm
• Atmosphere: Reflective, strategic, the chaos has been processed
=========================================

---

VISUAL COMPOSITION:

THE CHESSBOARD: Same board from the Prologue — but now ordered, clean, composed. Four key pieces remain, each spotlit in its pillar color:
- KNIGHT: Blue (#3B82F6) spotlight — complex L-shaped movement
- QUEEN: Red (#EF4444) spotlight — powerful, exposed
- ROOK: White (#F8FAFC) spotlight — immovable corner, vertical strength
- BISHOP: Orange (#F97316) spotlight — diagonal cutter, angled movement

The four color pools are distinct — they do not blend. Each piece isolated in its own light.

ENVIRONMENT — BATCAVE:
- Calm Batcave interior — stone walls, ordered equipment
- Screens in background showing consolidated data (clean, not chaotic)
- Blue (#3B82F6) ambient light — post-Clarity calm from the Prologue's resolution
- The cave feels strategic, reflective — not active, not panicked

LIGHTING:
- Four colored spotlights on the chess pieces
- Soft blue ambient throughout the cave
- Deep shadows at edges
- The mood is contemplative, analytical

---

CRITICAL:
- FULL BLEED — image extends to all edges, NO margins
- Four pieces with four DISTINCT pillar color highlights
- Title text clearly legible against dark upper area
- DI × SCU watermark PROMINENT in bottom-left
- The Batcave should feel CALM — this is post-Prologue reflection
```

---

## SLIDE 01: THE CONNECTION

```
Create a FULL BLEED digital comic panel in Dark Knight noir photorealistic style at 16:9 aspect ratio (1920x1080px). The image must extend to ALL EDGES with NO margins, borders, or frames.

SCENE: Prologue memory fragments dissolve into a clean ordered chessboard. Past chaos to present clarity.

LAYOUT: 2-PANEL horizontal split with 1-2 pixel thin white line between panels.

---

PANEL 1 (left half — DESATURATED PAST):
Memory fragments from the Prologue — overlapping, faded, dreamlike. Everything is DESATURATED — washed out, grey-toned, past-tense. The fragments overlap like ghostly afterimages — not clean panels, but layered memories.

MEMORY FRAGMENT 1 — Gotham burning in the background, fires, smoke, chaos.

MEMORY FRAGMENT 2 — The Joker's face flickering on screens:
THE JOKER FULL DESCRIPTION (desaturated memory):
- Face & Body: Heath Ledger, Caucasian man, early 30s, gaunt face, manic wide eyes, 6'1", lean wiry build
- Makeup: Smeared white face paint covering entire face, messy red lipstick extending into Glasgow smile scars on both cheeks, black eye makeup smudged around both eyes in uneven circles
- Hair: Greasy, stringy, green-tinged dirty blonde hair, medium length, unkempt and pushed back
- Costume: Purple (#4A0080) long coat visible on flickering screen
- Visible on a screen — flickering, unstable, DESATURATED like all memories in this panel

MEMORY FRAGMENT 3 — A damaged chessboard with scattered pieces.

MEMORY FRAGMENT 4 — Batman rising in silhouette:
BATMAN FULL DESCRIPTION (desaturated memory):
- Face & Body: Christian Bale, Caucasian man, mid-30s, strong jaw, athletic muscular build, 6'0"
- Costume: Full black Batsuit — matte black armoured plates, black cape, pointed cowl with ear extensions, lower face and jaw exposed, black gauntlets, utility belt, armoured boots
- Silhouetted against light — rising, DESATURATED like all memories in this panel

ALL MEMORY FRAGMENTS are faded, grey-toned, overlapping — past-tense visual quality throughout.

PANEL 2 (right half — FULL COLOR PRESENT):
- A clean chessboard in sharp focus — FULL COLOR, present tense
- Four pieces spotlit in pillar colors:
  - Knight: Blue (#3B82F6)
  - Queen: Red (#EF4444)
  - Rook: White (#F8FAFC)
  - Bishop: Orange (#F97316)
- The board is ordered, legible, composed
- Blue (#3B82F6) ambient light on the board surface

LIGHTING:
- Panel 1: Washed out, grey, faded — memory lighting
- Panel 2: Clean, sharp, four distinct color pools — present-tense clarity
- The contrast between panels IS the message

TEXT IN THIS PANEL:
- CAPTION BOX (dark navy #1a1a4e fill, white text, bottom spanning both panels): "You watched Batman face chaos. Now see what was really happening."

---

DI × SCU WATERMARK: Add barely visible "DI × SCU" text in bottom-left corner, white color, 2% of image width, very faint, approximately 30% opacity.

ORIENTATION TAG: None for this slide (opening — no tags yet).

---

CRITICAL:
- FULL BLEED — extends to all edges, NO margins
- ONE caption box only
- DESATURATED left panel vs FULL COLOR right panel — the shift must be dramatic
- Four chess pieces in Panel 2 each have distinct pillar color spotlights
```

---

## SLIDE 02: FRAMEWORK REVEAL — THE FOUR PIECES

```
Create a FULL BLEED digital comic panel in Dark Knight noir photorealistic style at 16:9 aspect ratio (1920x1080px). The image must extend to ALL EDGES with NO margins, borders, or frames.

SCENE: Four chess pieces isolated on a board, each spotlit in its pillar color against deep darkness.

LAYOUT: Single panel filling entire frame. Dramatic spotlight lighting against dark background.

---

VISUAL COMPOSITION:

FOUR PIECES arranged left to right on a wooden chessboard:
- KNIGHT: Blue (#3B82F6) spotlight pool — the piece sits in its own circle of blue light. Complex L-shaped silhouette.
- QUEEN: Red (#EF4444) spotlight pool — tall, commanding, powerful. Red light creates dramatic shadows.
- ROOK: White (#F8FAFC) spotlight pool — vertical, imposing, corner piece. Stark white light, no grey.
- BISHOP: Orange (#F97316) spotlight pool — angled, diagonal movement implied. Warm orange glow.

Each piece casts a long dramatic shadow behind it. The four pools of light do NOT blend — they remain distinct, separate, named.

ENVIRONMENT:
- Deep dark Batcave background — almost pure black (#0A1628)
- The chessboard surface is barely visible except where the four spotlights fall
- Stone walls faintly visible in deep shadow
- The focus is entirely on the four pieces and their colors

LIGHTING:
- Four distinct overhead spotlights — one per piece, each in its pillar color
- No ambient light — only the four pools
- Deep shadows between the pieces
- Each piece is fully illuminated by its color only

TEXT IN THIS PANEL:
- CAPTION BOX (dark navy #1a1a4e fill, white text, bottom of panel): "Every decision under pressure follows the same pattern."

---

DI × SCU WATERMARK: Add barely visible "DI × SCU" text in bottom-left corner, white color, 2% of image width, very faint, approximately 30% opacity.

ORIENTATION TAG: None for this slide (framework establishing — no pillar tags yet).

---

CRITICAL:
- FULL BLEED — extends to all edges, NO margins
- ONE caption box only
- Four pieces, four DISTINCT colors — no blending between light pools
- Deep dark background — the pieces and their lights are the entire composition
```

---

## SLIDE 03: FRAMEWORK REVEAL — THE CHAIN

```
Create a FULL BLEED digital comic panel in Dark Knight noir photorealistic style at 16:9 aspect ratio (1920x1080px). The image must extend to ALL EDGES with NO margins, borders, or frames.

SCENE: Four chess pieces in a horizontal line connected by a golden chain with arrows. The framework is named.

LAYOUT: Single panel filling entire frame. Clean, infographic-like composition within comic style.

---

VISUAL COMPOSITION:

THE CHAIN — four pieces arranged in a clean horizontal line, left to right:
1. KNIGHT — bathed in blue (#3B82F6) glow. Text label below the piece: "CLARITY" in blue.
2. QUEEN — bathed in red (#EF4444) glow. Text label below: "COURAGE" in red.
3. ROOK — bathed in white (#F8FAFC) glow. Text label below: "COMMITMENT" in white.
4. BISHOP — bathed in orange (#F97316) glow. Text label below: "MOVEMENT" in orange.

A GOLDEN LINE (#D4A843) connects the four pieces with directional arrows: → → →
The line has a subtle energy glow — warm gold, slightly luminous, like a current flowing through.

ENVIRONMENT:
- Dark Batcave background (#0A1628)
- The four pieces sit on a clean surface — no full chessboard, just the four pieces in a line
- The golden connecting line is the dominant visual element alongside the pieces

LIGHTING:
- Each piece lit in its pillar color
- The golden line provides warm ambient glow between pieces
- Deep dark background — the chain and pieces are everything

TEXT IN THIS PANEL:
- CAPTION BOX (dark navy #1a1a4e fill, white text, top of panel): "This isn't theory. This is what happened when Batman decided — and what happens every time you do."
- FOOTER TEXT (white, medium, bottom area): "Decisive Intelligence is the ability to move this chain fast."

---

DI × SCU WATERMARK: Add barely visible "DI × SCU" text in bottom-left corner, white color, 2% of image width, very faint, approximately 30% opacity.

ORIENTATION TAG: None for this slide (framework establishing).

---

CRITICAL:
- FULL BLEED — extends to all edges, NO margins
- ONE caption box and ONE footer text
- Four labeled pieces with golden connecting arrows
- The golden line must feel like energy flowing left to right
- Labels ("CLARITY", "COURAGE", "COMMITMENT", "MOVEMENT") must be clearly readable in their respective pillar colors
```

---

## SLIDE 04: PILLAR 1 TITLE — CLARITY *(BREATHER)*

```
Create a FULL BLEED digital comic panel in Dark Knight noir photorealistic style at 16:9 aspect ratio (1920x1080px). The image must extend to ALL EDGES with NO margins, borders, or frames.

SCENE: Section divider — the Knight chess piece dominates the frame. Deep blue environment. The Joker's face haunts the shadows.

LAYOUT: Single panel filling entire frame.

---

VISUAL COMPOSITION:

THE KNIGHT: A large chess knight piece — approximately 40% of the frame height — positioned center. Lit in deep BLUE (#3B82F6). Detailed carved wood texture. The piece feels monumental, significant.

BACKGROUND:
- Deep blue (#3B82F6) dominant color throughout — the Clarity pillar owns this frame
- The Joker's face barely visible in the shadows behind the Knight — approximately 15% opacity

THE JOKER FULL DESCRIPTION:
- Face & Body: Heath Ledger, Caucasian man, early 30s, gaunt face, manic wide eyes, 6'1", lean wiry build
- Makeup: Smeared white face paint covering entire face, messy red lipstick extending into Glasgow smile scars on both cheeks, black eye makeup smudged around both eyes in uneven circles
- Hair: Greasy, stringy, green-tinged dirty blonde hair, medium length, unkempt and pushed back
- Costume: Purple (#4A0080) long coat over rumpled green (#2D5A27) waistcoat, patterned shirt, mismatched clothing underneath
- The Joker is GHOSTLY — faded, shadowy, barely visible at approximately 15% opacity. A memory haunting the shadows, not a physical presence.

LIGHTING:
- Deep blue wash over everything
- The Knight piece is the brightest element — blue spotlight from above
- The Joker's face in the background has almost no light — shadow presence only

TEXT IN THIS PANEL:
- "PILLAR 1: CLARITY" — White (#FFFFFF), large text, upper-center area
- "The Joker's Game" — White (#FFFFFF), smaller text, beneath pillar title

---

DI × SCU WATERMARK: Add barely visible "DI × SCU" text in bottom-left corner, white color, 2% of image width, very faint, approximately 30% opacity.

ORIENTATION TAG: Top-right corner — "[ CLARITY ]" text in blue (#3B82F6), approximately 1.5% of image width, 40% opacity.

BREATHER SLIDE: Section divider. Low cognitive load. One piece. One color. One ghost.

---

CRITICAL:
- FULL BLEED — extends to all edges, NO margins
- Deep blue dominant — the entire frame is Clarity's color
- Knight piece large and central — approximately 40% of frame height
- Joker ghostly in background — barely visible, approximately 15% opacity
- Title text clearly readable
```

---

## SLIDE 05: WHEN CLARITY BREAKS

```
Create a FULL BLEED digital comic panel in Dark Knight noir photorealistic style at 16:9 aspect ratio (1920x1080px). The image must extend to ALL EDGES with NO margins, borders, or frames.

SCENE: Information overload — four simultaneous crises shown in chaotic overlapping panels. Batman is frozen. The Joker is on screen.

LAYOUT: 4-PANEL FRAGMENTED — panels overlap each other with NO clean borders. Panels are tilted at slight angles and stack on top of each other. The layout itself creates visual chaos and cognitive overload.

---

PANEL 1 (upper-left, tilted 3 degrees):
- Gotham fires — buildings burning, smoke rising
- Emergency vehicles, flashing lights
- Chaotic, distant, multiple fires

PANEL 2 (upper-right, overlapping Panel 1):
- Split screens showing Ferry A and Ferry B on dark water
- Hospital countdown timer visible on another screen
- An unknown fourth crisis on another screen
- Red emergency lighting

PANEL 3 (lower-left, overlapping Panels 1 and 2):

BATMAN FULL DESCRIPTION:
- Face & Body: Christian Bale, Caucasian man, mid-30s, strong jaw, intense eyes, athletic muscular build, 6'0"
- Costume: Full black Batsuit — matte black armoured plates covering torso, arms, and legs. Black cape draped from shoulders. Pointed cowl covering head with pointed ear extensions, lower face and jaw exposed. Black gauntlets with fin blades on forearms. Black utility belt at waist. Black armoured boots.
- Expression: Overwhelmed, frozen — eyes darting between screens, jaw clenched, paralysed by inputs
- Action: Surrounded by holographic data streams, hands at sides, NOT moving
- Position: Center of Panel 3

Blue (#3B82F6) data streams are distorted by noise — Clarity's color corrupted by overload.

PANEL 4 (lower-right, overlapping all):

THE JOKER (on flickering screen):
- Face & Body: Heath Ledger, Caucasian man, early 30s, gaunt face, manic wide eyes, 6'1", lean wiry build
- Makeup: Smeared white face paint covering entire face, messy red lipstick extending into Glasgow smile scars on both cheeks, black eye makeup smudged around both eyes in uneven circles
- Hair: Greasy, stringy, green-tinged dirty blonde hair, medium length, unkempt and pushed back
- Costume: Purple (#4A0080) long coat visible on screen
- Expression: Gleeful, taunting, head tilted
- Visible on a flickering, unstable screen image

TEXT IN THIS PANEL:
- SPEECH BUBBLE (white fill, black text, JAGGED irregular edges — Joker's style, positioned near Panel 4 screen): "Save one. Lose three. Or save none. Or… maybe I'm lying about all of it."
- CAPTION BOX (dark navy #1a1a4e fill, white text, bottom spanning all panels): "Information overload looks like clarity. It's not. It's paralysis dressed up as analysis."

---

DI × SCU WATERMARK: Add barely visible "DI × SCU" text in bottom-left corner, white color, 2% of image width, very faint, approximately 30% opacity.

ORIENTATION TAG: Top-right corner — "[ CLARITY ]" text in blue (#3B82F6), approximately 1.5% of image width, 40% opacity.

COLOR ANCHOR: Blue (#3B82F6) data streams distorted by noise — Clarity's color is present but corrupted. The information exists but overwhelms.

---

CRITICAL:
- FULL BLEED — extends to all edges, NO margins
- Panels OVERLAP chaotically — this is not a clean grid
- ONE speech bubble (Joker) with JAGGED irregular edges
- ONE caption box
- Batman is FROZEN — not deciding, not moving
- Blue accent distorted by visual noise throughout
```

---

## SLIDE 06: WHEN CLARITY HOLDS — ALFRED

```
Create a FULL BLEED digital comic panel in Dark Knight noir photorealistic style at 16:9 aspect ratio (1920x1080px). The image must extend to ALL EDGES with NO margins, borders, or frames.

SCENE: Alfred removes screens and chess pieces — visual subtraction. Clean composition contrasts the chaos of Slide 05.

LAYOUT: 2-PANEL horizontal split with 1-2 pixel thin white line between panels. CLEAN borders — deliberately contrasting the previous slide's chaos.

---

PANEL 1 (left half):

ALFRED PENNYWORTH FULL DESCRIPTION:
- Face & Body: Michael Caine, elderly Caucasian British man, mid-70s, grey hair neatly combed, kind weathered face, gentle knowing eyes, slim build, 5'10"
- Costume: Dark charcoal (#374151) waistcoat over white (#FFFFFF) dress shirt, dark navy (#1E3A5F) tie, charcoal (#374151) dress trousers, polished black shoes
- Expression: Calm, methodical — no hesitation, he knows exactly what he's doing
- Action: RIGHT HAND reaching out to turn off a screen — physically removing noise from the environment
- Position: Center of Panel 1, medium shot (waist up)

ENVIRONMENT — BATCAVE:
- The same Batcave from previous slides — but Alfred is SIMPLIFYING it
- A screen behind Alfred emits clean blue (#3B82F6) light — Clarity's color, calm and ordered
- Some screens already turned off — dark rectangles where chaos used to be

LIGHTING:
- Clean blue (#3B82F6) ambient — the environment itself reflects clarity arriving
- Warm practical light on Alfred's face
- The blue is calm, not cold — this is Clarity achieved

PANEL 2 (right half):
- CLOSE-UP of Alfred's hand removing chess pieces from a chessboard
- Half the pieces already removed — the board is SIMPLER
- One clear objective visible on the simplified board
- Blue (#3B82F6) light falls on the board surface
- The hand is steady, deliberate — each removal is purposeful

TEXT IN THIS PANEL:
- SPEECH BUBBLE (white fill, black text, black 2px outline, tail pointing to Alfred in Panel 1): "Master Wayne. You can't save everything. But you can stop the thing that collapses the rest."
- CAPTION BOX (dark navy #1a1a4e fill, white text, bottom spanning both panels): "Clarity isn't more information. It's ruthless subtraction."

---

DI × SCU WATERMARK: Add barely visible "DI × SCU" text in bottom-left corner, white color, 2% of image width, very faint, approximately 30% opacity.

ORIENTATION TAG: Top-right corner — "[ CLARITY ]" text in blue (#3B82F6), approximately 1.5% of image width, 40% opacity.

COLOR ANCHOR: Blue (#3B82F6) ambient light throughout — Clarity's color is now CLEAN, not corrupted. The visual shift from Slide 05 IS the metaphor.

---

CRITICAL:
- FULL BLEED — extends to all edges, NO margins
- ONE speech bubble (Alfred) and ONE caption box
- CLEAN layout deliberately contrasts Slide 05's chaos
- Alfred's action of REMOVING — turning off screens, removing pieces — must be clear
- Blue glow is calm and ordered — Clarity achieved
```

---

## SLIDE 07: CLARITY APPLIED *(v3.1 TRIMMED)*

```
Create a FULL BLEED digital comic panel in Dark Knight noir photorealistic style at 16:9 aspect ratio (1920x1080px). The image must extend to ALL EDGES with NO margins, borders, or frames.

SCENE: Batman makes the call — pointing at a single screen. Paired with the reader's own Clarity question.

LAYOUT: 2-PANEL horizontal split with 1-2 pixel thin white line between panels.

---

PANEL 1 (left half):

## SLIDE 08: PILLAR 2 TITLE — COURAGE *(BREATHER)*

```
Create a FULL BLEED digital comic panel in Dark Knight noir photorealistic style at 16:9 aspect ratio (1920x1080px). The image must extend to ALL EDGES with NO margins, borders, or frames.

SCENE: Section divider — the Queen chess piece dominates. Deep red environment. Ferries ghost in the background.

LAYOUT: Single panel filling entire frame. Slightly TILTED/asymmetric composition — the Queen's power destabilises the frame.

---

VISUAL COMPOSITION:

THE QUEEN: A large chess queen piece — approximately 40% of the frame height — positioned center. Lit in deep RED (#EF4444). Tall, commanding, powerful presence. The piece feels imposing.

BACKGROUND:
- Deep red (#EF4444) dominant color throughout — the Courage pillar owns this frame
- Two ferries barely visible on dark water — approximately 15% opacity, ghostly shapes in the red darkness

LIGHTING:
- Deep red wash over everything
- The Queen piece is the brightest element — red spotlight from above
- The ferries in the background are almost invisible — shadows on water
- The mood is tense, uncertain, exposed

TEXT IN THIS PANEL:

- Deep red dominant — the entire frame is Courage's color
- Queen piece large and central
- Tilted/asymmetric composition — nothing stable about Courage
- Ferries ghostly in background — approximately 15% opacity
```

PANEL 2 (bottom-left, smaller):
- Interior of Ferry A — civilian passengers
- A CIVILIAN MAN — middle-aged, ordinary clothes, trembling — holds a detonator in both hands

---

DI × SCU WATERMARK: Add barely visible "DI × SCU" text in bottom-left corner, white color, 2% of image width, very faint, approximately 30% opacity.

- Costume: Military-style tactical vest (olive/brown) over bare muscular arms, dark cargo pants with multiple pockets, heavy black combat boots, fingerless gloves

SCENE: Batman climbs the pit wall WITHOUT the rope. Silhouetted against white sky above. Full commitment — no safety net.

- Position: Upper-center of frame, silhouetted against the white sky above

THE ROPE:
- A rope hangs in the center of the pit — VISIBLE but UNUSED

  "Where are you keeping the rope?"
  "What would happen if you let go?"

- Action: At a command post, radio in one hand, turning to officers behind him with the other hand directing
- Position: Center of Panel 2, medium shot

Orange (#F97316) light from the bridge fire visible through the command post window — the fire is reaching the system.

- Citizens seeing the fire on the bridge — emerging from doorways
- Police vehicles starting to move — officers running to positions
- People emerging, pointing at the fire, beginning to move

LAYOUT: 2-PANEL horizontal split with 1-2 pixel thin white line between panels.

---

PANEL 1 (left half — AFTERMATH):
- Gotham aftermath — the city changed, not saved. New information emerging from wreckage.
- Buildings standing but damaged. Streets clearing but not clean.
- Mixed lighting — all four pillar colors present in subdued form:
  - Blue (#3B82F6) from police screens
  - Red (#EF4444) from emergency vehicles
  - White (#F8FAFC) from structural spotlights
  - Orange (#F97316) from residual fire glow
- The aftermath generates NEW INPUT — new information that demands new clarity

PANEL 2 (right half — THE FLYWHEEL):
- Four chess pieces arranged in a CIRCLE (not a line) on a clean surface
- Golden (#D4A843) connecting loop between them — a continuous cycle:
  CLARITY (blue, Knight) → COURAGE (red, Queen) → COMMITMENT (white, Rook) → MOVEMENT (orange, Bishop) → back to CLARITY
- The golden line cycles through all four pillar colors at each segment connecting the pieces
- The circle is complete — the chain loops

SCENE: Three chessboards showing progressive simplification across three flywheel cycles. Many pieces → fewer → three.

LAYOUT: 3-PANEL horizontal row with 1-2 pixel thin white lines between panels.

---

PANEL 1 (left third — CYCLE 1):
- A chessboard with MANY pieces — cluttered, noisy, overwhelming
- The Joker's influence — flickering screens visible in background, chaos energy
- Blue (#3B82F6) and red (#EF4444) tint — Clarity and Courage colors dominant
- Text label in the panel: "CYCLE 1" — white, small
- The board feels impossible — too many pieces, too many threats

PANEL 2 (center third — CYCLE 2):
- A chessboard with FEWER pieces — simplified but higher stakes
- Bane's influence — cracked concrete visible, structural damage in background
- White (#F8FAFC) and orange (#F97316) tint — Commitment and Movement colors dominant
- Text label: "CYCLE 2" — white, small
- The board is clearer but the remaining pieces matter more

PANEL 3 (right third — CYCLE 3):

- No external influence — no Joker, no Bane. Just the board and the player.
- All four pillar colors in harmony — blue, red, white, orange blended naturally
- Text label: "CYCLE 3" — white, small
- The board is almost empty — the move is obvious. Decisive.

LIGHTING:
- Progressive brightening: Panel 1 is darkest and noisiest, Panel 3 is cleanest and most lit
- Each panel carries its cycle's pillar color emphasis

TEXT IN THIS PANEL:
- CAPTION BOX (dark navy #1a1a4e fill, white text, bottom spanning all panels): "Decisive Intelligence isn't one decision. It's the speed at which you move through the chain — again and again."

- Cooler light — slightly blue-grey, in shadow. Contrast with the warm foreground.
- NO pillar colors on the empty board — grey, neutral, unknown
- Visible enough to register but deliberately unexplained
- The viewer should notice it and wonder

ENVIRONMENT — BATCAVE:
- Batcave interior — stone walls, equipment
- Warm light in foreground (victorious board) vs cool light in background (empty board)
- The temperature split is the visual tension

LIGHTING:
- Warm golden (#D4A843) light on the foreground board — resolution, warmth
- Cool grey-blue on the background board — unknown, waiting
