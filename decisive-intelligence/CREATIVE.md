**Dominant Villain:** Ra's Al Ghul / Ducard
**Film:** Batman Begins (2005)
**Purpose:** Experience the framework being LEARNED

**Five Pivotal Scenes:**
1. **Scene 14:** Blindfolded Training → CLARITY ("Always mind your surroundings")
2. **Scene 15-16:** Bat Cave → COURAGE ("Master your own fear")
3. **Scene 17:** Execution Refusal → COMMITMENT ("The will to act")
4. **Scene 21:** Manor Burns → MOVEMENT (Forward is the only direction)
5. **Scene 24:** Train Fight → ALL FOUR (Student surpasses mentor)

**Framework Naming:** NO — experienced, not named
**Joker Tease:** Gordon shows Joker card (Scene 25-26)

---

### EP2: THE TEST
**Delivery:** During event (in-person with simulation)
**Dominant Villain:** Joker
**Film:** The Dark Knight (2008)
**Purpose:** Framework NAMED and TESTED against chaos

1. **CHOICE #1:** Which crisis matters most? → CLARITY
2. **CHOICE #2:** Who do I save? (Rachel vs Harvey) → COURAGE
3. **CHOICE #3:** Protect Harvey's legacy? (Tackle Two-Face) → COMMITMENT
4. **CHOICE #4:** Become the villain to save the city? → MOVEMENT
