## Session Log

### 2026-02-21 — Session 9: Director's Extended Cut — EP1 Screenplay Complete
- **KLP Success:** Presentation went well, Raja wants 2-hour marketing conference version
- **Director's Extended Cut proposed and approved:**
  - ~35 min story + ~5 min post-credits per episode
  - Universal work parallels (no jargon — every professional connects)
  - Pillars NAMED in the story (Director override)
  - Same characters (Ra's, Bruce, Alfred, Gordon) in workplace post-credits
- **EP1 Extended Cut Analysis:** Compression map, slide estimates, 12 Gemini learnings, 4 Director questions resolved
- **EP1 Post-Credits Workplace Story drafted:** 14 panels, Bruce as new hire, Ra's as mentor
- **EP1 Extended Cut Screenplay built (EC 1.2.0):**
  - Started from 124-panel original, applied pillar naming throughout
  - Thomas Wayne = Linus Roache (rendering fix for all 3 panels)
  - 5 major restorations from Batman Begins: Opera/Murder/Gordon (+10), Blue Flower (+5), Theatricality (+4), Lucius Fox (+6), First Night (+5)
  - 2 visual moments: Symbol is born (bat on arm), Shadow transformation (shadow = bat)
  - 11 KLP gap fixes cross-referenced: cover panel, trapped under debris, Alfred rescue, triptych captions, "I'll look into it", full credits, departure visual, Ducard ideology line, mentor approval, callback caption, Rachel at party
  - Final count: 168 panels
- **EP2 bridge beat for post-credits:** In progress
- Commits: 67eed2f
- Next: EP2 bridge beat → EP1 Gemini prompts

### 2026-02-21 — Session 8: EP3 Prompt Fixes + EP1 Cover + Presentation Guide + Video R&D
- **EP3 Slide fixes (Gemini-tested with Director):**
  - Slide 28: Gordon line "He's alive" → "He didn't break" (continuity fix — Gordon met Bruce in Slide 27)
  - Slide 30: Full rewrite of 6-panel rematch — character blocks in all panels, visual progression, hallucinated text fix, Batman line "I came back without the rope" moved to correct panel
  - Slide 32: Expanded from quad to 6-panel grid — each pillar gets own panel with colored glow
  - Slide 33: Removed Gary Oldman (Gemini blocked), then restored after fixing abstract flashback panel
  - Slide 34: Reduced to 2 captions (garbled text fix), Bruce pushed to blurred background
  - Slide 41: RDJ Doom reveal rewritten for SDCC green suit look — "Robert Downey Jr." works, "RDJ" blocked
  - Slide 42: Unmasked panel matched to Slide 41 green suit costume
  - Slide 43: Removed actor name from masked Doom (unnecessary, risks block)
- **EP1 Cover:** Added Slide 0 — mountain monastery, pristine chessboard, dawn. Matches EP2/EP3 cover format.
- **KLP Presentation Guide created:** `reference/DI_Presentation_Guide.md`
  - Full script for Director's KLP talk — opening, 3 bridges, closing
  - 3-line pillar summaries after each episode
  - Personal touches: Lokesh reference, Vikram/Coolie, Tony Stark quote, MCU confession, Raja/Susan/Adam shoutouts
  - Building-side work parallels per episode
  - Quick reference card + contingency plans
- **Video generation R&D:**
  - Tested Google Veo 3 for image-to-video (8 sec clips, 9 min/week limit)
  - Created 4-shot Bane encounter test sequence — Shot 1 generated and approved in Gemini
  - Researched Kling AI ($10/mo, 60 sec clips, available in India) as primary alternative
  - Researched Seedance 2.0 (best quality but China-only, legal issues with Netflix/Sony)
  - Recommendation: Kling AI for now, Seedance when globally available
- **Gemini prompting learnings (new):**
  - "Robert Downey Jr." full name works; "RDJ" gets blocked — same content filter
  - Gemini leaks descriptive prompt language as visible text — strip adjectives like "precise, targeted, surgical"
  - "NO other text" instruction prevents hallucinated captions
  - Speaker must be VISIBLE in the panel for speech bubbles — off-panel attribution fails
  - One speaker per panel rule confirmed again
- Commits: d848213, 2435918

### 2026-02-17 — Session 7: EP3 Prompts v1.1 — Actor Names + Slide Rewrites
- **CRITICAL FIX:** Added actor names to ALL 46 slides' character blocks
  - v1.0 used generic descriptions ("Caucasian man, mid-40s") causing wrong actor renders
  - Gemini drew Ben Affleck instead of Christian Bale
  - Fix: Christian Bale, Tom Hardy, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Liam Neeson,
    Heath Ledger, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Robert Downey Jr. added to every block
- **Slide 21 rewrite (Pit climb triptych):**
  - Panel 2: Vertical shaft composition, camera from below, rope visible, "NOT gripping"
  - Panel 3: Simplified to single cot scene with Blind Prisoner (full character block)
  - Tested in Gemini: APPROVED by Director
- **Slide 24 rewrite (ropeless climb 6-panel):**
  - Full character blocks in all 6 panels (were missing entirely)
  - NO ROPE contrast with Slide 21 emphasized throughout
  - Narrative arc: silence → grip → chanting → decision → leap → triumph
  - Tested in Gemini: APPROVED by Director
- **Slide 25 rewrite (Rise):**
  - Costume continuity fix: torn grey prison shirt, not clean button-up
  - Pose clarified: standing with arms raised (not climbing)
  - v1 tested: duplicate "Rise." caption + wrong costume → full rewrite
  - v2 awaiting Gemini test
- **Gemini prompting learnings:**
  - Actor names are REQUIRED for correct likeness — generic descriptions fail
  - "WHAT NOT TO DRAW" sections prevent Gemini from filling in wrong defaults
  - Camera angle specs (FROM BELOW, FROM INSIDE) dramatically improve composition
  - ONE moment per panel — never two events in same panel
