## Episode Architecture

### EP1: THE PROLOGUE
**Delivery:** Pre-event (cold open, no context)
**Dominant Villain:** Joker
**Purpose:** Experience reactive decisiveness

**Four Choices Structure:**
1. **CHOICE #1:** Which crisis matters most? (Rachel vs Harvey) → CLARITY
2. **CHOICE #2:** Who do I save? (Joker's lie, explosion) → COURAGE
3. **CHOICE #3:** Protect Harvey's legacy? (Tackle Two-Face) → COMMITMENT
4. **CHOICE #4:** Become the villain to save the city? (Take the fall) → MOVEMENT

**Key Joker Face-to-Face Moments:**
- [ ] Interrogation room confrontation
- [ ] Hospital scene (Harvey's corruption)
- [ ] Final confrontation
- [ ] Post-capture (laughing, "I won")

### EP2: THE PLAYBOOK

**Dominant Villain:** Joker (as teaching case study)
**Purpose:** Framework named and understood

- Each pillar: Joker's challenge → Framework answer → Application → Worksheet

**Key Joker Presence:**

- [ ] Face-to-face memories with full color

### EP3: THE TRIGGER
**Delivery:** Post-event (takeaway, learning by doing)

**Structure:**
- False victory (Joker defeated, settling)

- Framework ADAPTS (same pillars, different application)
- Victory (portability proven)
- Post-credits: Doom full reveal ("New Mask, Same Task")

**Key Bane Moments:**
