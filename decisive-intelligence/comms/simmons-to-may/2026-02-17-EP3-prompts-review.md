## Key Production Decisions

### 1. Gemini Compatibility (Applied EP1/EP2 Learnings)

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Actor names blocked | Physical descriptions only — no names |
| Child safety blocks | No children in any panels |
| Dark Knight Batsuit | Full description without actor reference |
| Character consistency | Full blocks in EVERY panel |

### 2. May's Production Notes Applied

| Note | Implementation |
|------|----------------|
| Target 45-50 slides | 46 slides delivered |
| Heavy grid usage | 3 × 6-panel grids, 5 × quad panels, 4 × triptychs |
| Bane costume simpler | Consistent tactical vest description throughout |
| Scene 8.4 NO TEXT | Slide 13 — completely silent, maximum impact |
| RDJ reveal prominent | Slide 41 — full face, clear lighting, the smirk |
| New chessboard bigger | Slide 43 — army of pieces, visual escalation |

### 3. Compression Techniques

| Technique | Count |
|-----------|-------|
| 6-panel grids | 3 |
| Quad panels (2×2) | 5 |
| Triptychs | 4 |
| Split panels | 12 |
| Single splash | 22 |

---

## Framework Arc Visual Structure

| Phase | Slides | Visual Focus |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| Framework BROKEN | 9-14 | Each pillar failing, the break (silent) |
| Framework REBUILT | 19-25 | Pit scenes, climb, rope removal |
| Framework APPLIED | 28-31 | Battle, rematch, pillars working |
| Framework PASSED ON | 32-37 | Legacy, Blake, Alfred's dream |

---

## Doctor Doom Sequence (8 Slides)

| Slide | Content |
|-------|---------|
| 39 | Portal opens — green/gold energy |
| 40 | Doom steps through — boots, armor, cloak |
| 41 | **RDJ FACE REVEAL** — unmasked, holding mask, the smirk |
| 42 | Mask goes on — transformation split panel |
| 43 | New chessboard — army of pieces |
| 44 | Doom's eyes through mask — green glow |
| 45 | Black page — "will return" |
| 46 | Credits |

RDJ face is PROMINENT in Slide 41 — full face, clear lighting, recognizable smirk. The audience SEES him before he becomes Doom.

## Review Request

Please verify:

1. **Pit sequence pacing** — 11 slides (24%) — adequate for transformation?
2. **The Break (Slide 13)** — Silent panel preserved, maximum impact?
3. **Framework rebuild arc** — CLARITY → COURAGE → COMMITMENT clear?
4. **RDJ reveal** — Slide 41 prominence sufficient?
5. **Trilogy connections** — Ra's flashback, Joker reference, chessboard motif?
6. **Doom tease** — 8 slides (17%) — appropriate for post-credits?
