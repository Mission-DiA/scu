# DI Story Arc — Alignment Check

May,

Major pivot. Director has restructured the trilogy to follow the actual Nolan films. We're scrapping the Joker-first approach for a more logical progression.

---

## Where to Look

**Primary File:**
```
/scu/decisive-intelligence/reference/DI_Story_Arc.md
```

---

## The New Structure

| Episode | Villain | Film | Theme | Delivery |
|---------|---------|------|-------|----------|
| **EP1** | Ra's Al Ghul | Batman Begins | LEARN the framework | Pre-event |
| **EP2** | Joker | The Dark Knight | TEST the framework | During event |
| **EP3** | Bane + Doom | The Dark Knight Rises | ADAPT the framework | Post-event |

**The Thesis:** Decisive Intelligence is a discipline, not a moment.
- Ra's TEACHES the four pillars
- Joker ATTACKS the four pillars
- Bane BREAKS the pillars, Bruce REBUILDS them

---

## Why This Change

1. **Follows actual Nolan trilogy progression** — audiences know this arc
2. **Natural learning journey** — Learn → Test → Adapt
3. **Each villain represents different challenge type:**
   - Ra's = Ideology (mentor turned enemy)
   - Joker = Chaos (impossible choices)
   - Bane = Force (overwhelming destruction)
   - Doom = Unknown (multiverse tease)

---

## What I Need From You

### 1. Accessibility Check
- Does the "Learn → Test → Adapt" progression make sense for leadership training?
- Will participants connect Ra's (mentor) to their own leadership mentors?
- Is Bane's "breaking then rebuilding" too dark for the takeaway episode?

### 2. Pacing Considerations
- EP1 has training montage content — risk of feeling slow?
- EP2 has the most complexity (four crises) — is it too dense for during-event delivery?
- EP3 post-credits Doom — does multiverse tease feel earned or gimmicky?

### 3. Pillar Consistency
The four pillars manifest differently per episode:

| Pillar | EP1 (Ra's) | EP2 (Joker) | EP3 (Bane) |
|--------|------------|-------------|------------|
| CLARITY | "Mind your surroundings" | Subtract noise | Face brutal truth |
| COURAGE | Conquer fear | Act without certainty | Remove the rope |
| COMMITMENT | "Will to act" | Tackle Two-Face | Return broken |
| MOVEMENT | Manor burns | Take the fall | Light the flare |

Does this feel consistent enough to be recognizable, but varied enough to show evolution?

### 4. Previous Work
The Joker screenplay I wrote (28 scenes, 143 panels) will become EP2 reference material. Not wasted — repositioned.

---

## Estimated Scope

| Episode | Scenes | Panels |
|---------|--------|--------|
| EP1 | ~25 | ~120 |
| EP2 | ~28 | ~140 |
| EP3 | ~22 | ~110 |
| **TOTAL** | ~75 | ~370 |

## Questions for Director (May's Input Welcome)

1. EP1: How much of Ra's training do we show vs. imply?
2. EP2: Keep Four Choices structure from previous screenplay?
3. EP3: Include Selina Kyle/Catwoman or keep focused?
4. Doom: Is "New Mask, Same Task" the right tease line?

Director wants all three of us aligned before I proceed to screenplays.

Your thoughts?
