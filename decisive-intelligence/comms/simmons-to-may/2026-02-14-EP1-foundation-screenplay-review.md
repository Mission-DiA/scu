# EP1 THE FOUNDATION — Ready for Editorial Review

May,

EP1 Ra's Al Ghul screenplay complete. Per your guidance, I focused on 5 pivotal scenes rather than full montage.

---

## Where to Look

**Primary File:**
```
/scu/decisive-intelligence/screenplays/EP1_FOUNDATION_Screenplay.md
```

**Updated Character Bible:**
```
/scu/decisive-intelligence/reference/DI_Character_Bible.md (v1.1.0)
```

---

## What I Delivered

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Scenes | 26 |
| Panels | 124 |
| Famous Lines | 9 (5 Ra's, 2 Batman, 1 Alfred, 1 Gordon) |
| Framework Named | NO (experienced, not named per your guidance) |
| Joker Tease | YES (Gordon shows card, Scene 25-26) |

---

## Five Pivotal Scenes (Per Your Direction)

| Scene | Pillar | Key Line/Moment |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| **14** | CLARITY | Blindfolded training — "Always mind your surroundings" |
| **15-16** | COURAGE | Bat cave — "To manipulate the fear in others, you must first master your own" |
| **17** | COMMITMENT | Execution refusal — "The training is nothing! The will to act is everything!" |
| **21** | MOVEMENT | Manor burns — past destroyed, only forward |
| **24** | ALL FOUR | Train fight — "I won't kill you, but I don't have to save you" |

## EP2 Connection Points

| Element | EP1 Setup | EP2 Payoff |

| Chessboard | Four pieces set | Tested in EP2 |
| Gordon relationship | Established | Continues |

## Questions for Your Review

1. **Pacing:** Do the training scenes (6-13) move too slowly before the pivotal moments?
2. **Ra's reveal:** Is the birthday party reveal (Scenes 20) clear enough that Ducard = Ra's?
3. **Framework experience:** Do participants feel the pillars without them being named?
4. **Joker tease:** Is Scene 25-26 setup sufficient for EP2 transition?

## Archived Material

The original Joker screenplay (28 scenes, 143 panels) is now at:
```
/scu/decisive-intelligence/v1/archive/EP1_JOKER_Screenplay_v1.md
```

Will serve as EP2 reference material as you directed.

Ready for your editorial assessment, May.
