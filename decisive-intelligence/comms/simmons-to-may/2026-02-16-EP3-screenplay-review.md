# EP3 SCREENPLAY — REQUESTING EDITORIAL REVIEW

May,

EP3 THE ADAPTATION is complete. Bane breaks the framework. Bruce rebuilds it. Doom teases the future.

---

## Delivery Summary

|--------|-------|
| **Scenes** | 25 |
| **Panels** | ~118 |
| **Target Slides** | 45-50 |
| **Compression** | 2.5:1 |

---

## Structure

| Section | Scenes | Focus |
|---------|--------|-------|
| OPENING | 1-2 | False Peace, Recluse Bruce (8 years later) |
| ACT 1 | 3-5 | Bane arrives, Batman returns unprepared |
| ACT 2 | 6-8 | The Breaking — framework FAILS against force |
| ACT 3 | 9-12 | The Pit — framework REBUILT |
| ACT 4 | 13-16 | The Rise — framework APPLIED |
| ACT 5 | 17-20 | Victory, Pillars Recap |
| CLOSING | 21-22 | Legacy ("A hero can be anyone") |
| POST-CREDITS | 23-25 | Doctor Doom (RDJ) — 2+ slides |

---

## Scope Decisions (Director Approved)

| Character | Decision | Reason |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| **Selina Kyle** | SKIP | Not essential to framework, adds blocks |
| **Talia al Ghul** | SKIP | Complicates ending, dilutes Bane |
| **John Blake** | Background | One brief scene, legacy moment |
| **Doctor Doom** | 2+ slides | RDJ face reveal, sets up future |

---

## Framework Arc

| Pillar | BROKEN (ACT 2) | REBUILT (ACT 3-4) |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| **CLARITY** | No weakness to find in Bane | See brutal truth about himself |
| **COURAGE** | Action without preparation = suicide | Fear of death enables the climb |
| **COMMITMENT** | No safety net, no strength | Remove the rope, burn alternatives |
| **MOVEMENT** | Bane creates irreversibility for him | Act while broken, readiness follows |

---

## Famous Lines Placed

| Line | Scene |
|------|-------|
| "I am Gotham's reckoning" | 5 |
| "You merely adopted the dark. I was born in it." | 7 |
| "Victory has defeated you. Peace has cost you your strength." | 8 |
| "I will break you" | 8 |
| "When Gotham is ashes, you have my permission to die" | 8 |
| "The training is nothing. The will to act is everything." | 10 (Ra's flashback) |
| "A hero can be anyone" | 19 |
| "New Mask, Same Task" (Doom) | 25 |

---

## Trilogy Connections

| Element | Connection |
|---------|------------|
| **EP1 → EP3** | Ra's flashback in Pit scene, framework taught then shattered |
| **EP2 → EP3** | "Eight years since the Joker" opening, lie held |
| **Chessboard** | Appears dusty (opening), restored (closing), new game (Doom) |
| **Pillars** | Same colors, redefined meanings |

---

## Doctor Doom Post-Credits

| Slide | Content |
|-------|---------|
| 1 | Portal opens — green/gold energy |
| 2 | **RDJ FACE REVEAL** — unmasked, holding Doom mask, smirk |
| 3 | Doom masked — "New Mask, Same Task" — new chessboard behind him |

The audience SEES RDJ. The arc is left open. Future teased.

## Character Bible Update

Added Doctor Doom (v1.3.0):
- Doctor Doom (Masked) — full armor description
- Doctor Doom (Unmasked) — RDJ description with goatee, scars

---

## Review Request

Please verify:

1. **Arc continuity** — Does EP3 flow from EP1/EP2?
2. **Framework evolution** — Is the BROKEN → REBUILT arc clear?
3. **Bane portrayal** — Is force (not chaos) distinct from Joker?
4. **Pillar redefinitions** — Do the new meanings land?
5. **Doom tease** — Does 2+ slides work for setting up future?
6. **Pacing** — Does the Pit section have enough weight?
