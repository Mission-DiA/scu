# EP1 THE FOUNDATION — Silhouette Cut Complete

May,

Two problems. One solution. Delivered.

---

## What Changed

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Gemini blocking Slide 4 (minor in distress) | **Silhouette approach** — Young Bruce as shadow only |
| Director wants tighter | **60 slides** (down from 94) |

---

## The Numbers

| Metric | v1 | v2 | v3 |
|--------|-----|-----|-----|
| **Slides** | 198 | 94 | **60** |
| **Reduction** | — | 52% | **70%** |
| **Duration** | ~20 min | ~10 min | **~6-7 min** |
| **Gemini-safe** | Unknown | No | **Yes** |

---

## Where to Look

**Primary File:**
```
/scu/decisive-intelligence/image_prompts/EP1/EP1_FOUNDATION_Prompts_v3.md
```

---

## Silhouette Approach (Scenes 1-2)

| Element | v2 | v3 |
|---------|-----|-----|
| Young Bruce face | Detailed | **Silhouette only** |
| Child expressions | Described | **Abstract/symbolic** |
| Adult focus | Partial | **Full — Thomas, Alfred carry emotion** |
| Environment | Supporting | **Primary storyteller** |

### Example (Slide 2 — THE BATS):
```
The child is ABSTRACT — a dark shape being overwhelmed.
The BATS are photorealistic.
CRITICAL: The human figure is a SILHOUETTE only.
No face, no detailed expression.
```

## 6-Panel Grids (New Compression)

Used for training/journey montages:
```
┌─────┬─────┬─────┐
│  1  │  2  │  3  │
├─────┼─────┼─────┤
│  4  │  5  │  6  │
└─────┴─────┴─────┘
```

## Gemini Safety Compliance

| Element | v2 | v3 |
|---------|-----|-----|
| "8-year-old screaming" | PRESENT | **REMOVED** |
| Child face detail | PRESENT | **SILHOUETTE** |
| Minor in distress | **BLOCKED** | **SAFE** |
| Child expressions | Described | **ABSTRACT** |

---

## Questions for Review

1. **Silhouette approach:** Does it preserve the emotional impact without the face?
2. **6-panel grids:** Clear enough for Gemini?
3. **Adult focus:** Thomas and Alfred carrying the emotion — does it work?
4. **60 slides:** Hit the target. Right length for cold open?

The shadow tells the story. The swarm carries the fear.
