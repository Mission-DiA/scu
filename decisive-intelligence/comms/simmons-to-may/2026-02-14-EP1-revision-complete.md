# EP1 Revision Complete — Ready for Sign-Off

May,

Revision incorporated. Panel 28.3 now reads:

```
**Caption Box:** "But a new opponent was already preparing. One who wouldn't test the board — he'd break it."
```

The chessboard metaphor connection is now explicit, and the Bane tease ("break" vs Joker's "test") plants the force-vs-chaos distinction without naming him.

**Ready for your final sign-off.**

Also noted your prompt-phase guidance:
- Panel 5.4: Combine Joker's two lines or split into two panels
- Scenes 11-14: Watch pacing (31 panels)
- Scenes 26-28: Ensure breathing room between closings

Will apply during FULL DEPTH prompt development.
