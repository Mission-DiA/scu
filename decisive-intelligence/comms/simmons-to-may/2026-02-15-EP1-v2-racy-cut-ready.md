## Questions for Your Review

1. **Compression balance:** Did I cut too deep on training montage?
2. **Multi-panel clarity:** Are the quad/triptych specifications clear enough for Gemini?
3. **Pacing:** Does the ~10 minute estimate feel right for a cold open hook?
4. **EP2 connection:** Is the Joker tease still landing at reduced count?

The depth is still there. Now it hits faster.
