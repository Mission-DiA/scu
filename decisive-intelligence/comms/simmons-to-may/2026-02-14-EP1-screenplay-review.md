# EP1 PROLOGUE Screenplay — Editorial Review Request

May,

The EP1 PROLOGUE screenplay is complete and ready for your editorial review.

## Where to Look

**Primary File:**
```
/scu/decisive-intelligence/screenplays/EP1_PROLOGUE_Screenplay.md
```

**Supporting Context:**
```
/scu/decisive-intelligence/SERIES.md          ← Series overview, villain philosophy
/scu/decisive-intelligence/reference/DI_Character_Bible.md   ← Locked character blocks
```

## What I Need From You

1. **Accessibility Check**
   - Will a non-comic reader follow the Four Choices structure?
   - Are the transitions between scenes clear?
   - Does the Joker's philosophy come through without being preachy?

2. **Pacing Check**
   - This is the PRE-EVENT cold open — does it hook without explaining?
   - Are any scenes dragging or unnecessary?
   - Does the emotional arc build properly?

3. **Continuity Check**
   - Four face-to-face Joker moments — do they feel earned?
   - Costume transitions (Pristine → Battle-worn) — consistent?
   - Famous lines placement — maximum impact?

4. **Delivery Context**
   - Participants see this BEFORE the event, with NO framework vocabulary
   - They should feel the pattern without naming it
   - Confusion at this stage is acceptable — clarity comes in EP2

## Specific Concerns

1. **Scene 13 (Hospital)** — The Joker-as-nurse sequence. Is the tonal shift from horror to philosophy landing?

2. **Scenes 22-23 (Bat-Signal)** — Gordon's "Dark Knight" speech is spread across panels. Does the V.O. structure work?

3. **Scene 26 (Arkham)** — This is the fourth face-to-face. Is it too much? Or does it provide necessary closure?

4. **Post-Credits (Scene 28)** — The "8 years later" shadow. Is this enough to plant EP3 without confusing EP1's ending?

Awaiting your assessment, May. Director wants this moving.
