## What I Delivered

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Scenes | 28 |
| Total Panels | 137 |
| Dominant Villain | Joker |
| Framework Status | NAMED explicitly |
| EP1 Connection | ✅ Ra's training referenced |
| EP3 Setup | ✅ Bane post-credits tease |

---

## Structure

| Act | Focus | Scenes | Panels |
|-----|-------|--------|--------|
| OPENING | The Board | 1-2 | 1-5 |
| ACT 1 | The Chaos | 3-6 | 6-18 |
| ACT 2 | CLARITY | 7-10 | 19-34 |
| ACT 3 | COURAGE | 11-14 | 35-52 |
| ACT 4 | COMMITMENT | 15-19 | 53-72 |
| ACT 5 | MOVEMENT | 20-24 | 73-92 |
| CLOSING | The Dark Knight | 25-28 | 93-110 |

---

## Four Choices Structure

| Choice | Pillar | Test | Scene |
|--------|--------|------|-------|
| #1 | CLARITY | Which crisis matters most? | 7-8 |
| #2 | COURAGE | Act despite uncertain outcome | 11-12 |
| #3 | COMMITMENT | Destroy Harvey to save the child | 16-17 |
| #4 | MOVEMENT | Become the villain to save the city | 20-22 |

---

## Framework Naming (Key Difference from EP1)

| Pillar | Caption Box |
|--------|-------------|
| CLARITY | "Know what matters — even when everything is on fire." |
| COURAGE | "Act before you're ready — the cost might break you." |
| COMMITMENT | "Accept the cost you can't see." |
| MOVEMENT | "Burn the bridge behind you." |

**This is the key evolution from EP1:** The framework is now NAMED, not just experienced.

## Famous Lines Used

| Character | Line | Scene |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Joker | "Do I really look like a guy with a plan?" | 5 |
| Joker | "Tick tock, Batman." | 3 |
| Joker | "You made a choice. That makes you just like me." | 12 |
| Joker | "I'm not a monster. I'm just ahead of the curve." | 13 |

## Questions for Your Review

1. **Arc continuity:** Does the EP1 → EP2 transition flow naturally?
2. **Framework naming:** Are the pillar captions clear and impactful?
3. **Joker portrayal:** Enough face-to-face confrontation scenes?
4. **Four Choices:** Does each choice clearly test its pillar?
5. **Bane tease:** Does the post-credits set up EP3 effectively?

---

## Adapted From

Used `v1/archive/EP1_JOKER_Screenplay_v1.md` (28 scenes, 143 panels) as foundation, with key adaptations:
- Added EP1 connection (Ra's flashback)
- Added explicit pillar naming
- Updated post-credits from "Episode 2 coming" to "Bane tease"
- Refined structure for arc continuity

Ready for your editorial assessment, May.
