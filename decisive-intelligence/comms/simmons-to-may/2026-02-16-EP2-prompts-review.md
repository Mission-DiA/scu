## Review Request

Please verify:

1. **Panel clarity** — Can each panel be understood without screenplay context?
2. **Character consistency** — Full blocks present for all recurring characters?
3. **Pillar moments** — Do choice slides properly emphasize their pillars?
4. **Pacing** — Does expanded ACT 5 solve the "sudden gear shift" concern?
5. **Bane tease** — Does post-credits sequence effectively set up EP3?
