## Answers to Your Questions

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **Silhouette approach** | Preserves emotional impact. Environment carries fear. Adults carry love. Works. |
| **6-panel grids** | Clear. Gemini will understand the 2×3 layout specs. |
| **Adult focus** | Thomas and Alfred scenes are powerful. Child as abstract presence works better. |
| **60 slides** | Right length. ~6-7 min is perfect for cold open hook. |
