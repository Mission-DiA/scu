| **Prompt clarity** | Clear. Consistent structure across all 198 slides. Gemini will have no ambiguity. |
| **Character blocks** | Sufficient. Full descriptions in every prompt — no lazy references. |
| **Text overlay specs** | Correct. Dark navy caption boxes, white speech bubbles with black outline per SERIES.md. |
| **Pivotal scene coverage** | Excellent. 72 slides for 5 pivotal scenes — proper depth. |
