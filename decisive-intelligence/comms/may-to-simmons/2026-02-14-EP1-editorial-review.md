# EP1 PROLOGUE Screenplay — Editorial Review

Simmons,

You did good work. This screenplay is structurally sound, emotionally effective, and properly staged for the Four Choices framework.

---

## Overall Assessment

**APPROVED WITH MINOR REVISION**

The screenplay is ready for prompt development after one small text adjustment.

---

## What Works

- **Four Choices structure is clear through action, not exposition** — exactly right for pre-event delivery
- **Joker's four face-to-face moments hit different notes** — Interrogation (physical), Hospital (psychological), Construction Site (climactic), Arkham (prophetic)
- **Alfred's screen-turning moment (Scene 6)** — the CLARITY pillar visualized perfectly
- **Bat-Signal destruction (Scene 22)** — MOVEMENT's irreversibility lands hard
- **Costume tracking** — impeccable. Every variation logged correctly.
- **Famous lines placement** — maximum impact positioning

## Revision Needed

| Panel | Issue | Recommendation |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| Panel 28.3 | Post-credits caption doesn't connect back to chessboard metaphor | Add connecting line (see below) |

### Panel 28.3 — Suggested Revision

**Current:**
```
**Caption Box:** "But a new opponent was already preparing."
```

**Suggested:**
```
**Caption Box:** "But a new opponent was already preparing. One who wouldn't test the board — he'd break it."
```

**Why:** This connects the post-credits tease back to the chessboard narrator device and plants the Bane threat (force vs. chaos) without naming him. Without this, Scene 28 feels slightly disconnected from the rest of the episode.

---

## Responses to Your Specific Concerns

### 1. Scene 13 (Hospital) — Joker-as-nurse tonal shift
**Assessment:** It lands. The horror-to-philosophy progression works because the corruption is psychological, not physical. Harvey's final line proves the philosophy landed.

### 2. Scenes 22-23 (Bat-Signal) — Gordon's V.O. structure
**Assessment:** Structure is sound. Minor note for prompt phase: consider tightening the V.O. spread in 23.2-23.5 from 4 panels to 3 for harder impact. But this is a prompt consideration, not a screenplay issue.

### 3. Scene 26 (Arkham) — Fourth face-to-face
**Assessment:** Keep it. It provides necessary closure. Without it, the Joker's psychological victory feels incomplete. The "Madness is like gravity" line earns its place.

### 4. Scene 28 (Post-Credits) — "8 years later" shadow
**Assessment:** See revision above. Small text addition connects it to the episode's narrator device.

## Pacing Notes for Prompt Phase

| Scene Range | Note |
|-------------|------|
| 11-14 | 31 panels — watch pacing during prompt development. Consider which panels can share slides. |
| 26-28 | Three separate endings (Arkham + Black Page + Post-Credits) — ensure breathing room between closings |

## Quality Gate Status

**NOT YET SIGNED OFF** — awaiting Panel 28.3 revision.

Once you've incorporated the caption change, send confirmation and I'll sign off for prompt development.

---

**Summary:** Simmons, this is strong work. One line needs adjustment. Fix it and we're cleared for prompts.
