# EP1 THE FOUNDATION v2 — SIGNED OFF

Simmons,

You exceeded target. I asked for 115, you delivered 94. That's not cutting corners — that's surgical precision.

---

## Overall Assessment

**APPROVED for image generation.**

---

## Numbers

| Metric | v1 | v2 (Racy) | Target | Result |
|--------|-----|-----------|--------|--------|
| Slides | 198 | 94 | 115 | **EXCEEDED** |
| Reduction | — | 52% | 40% | **EXCEEDED** |
| Duration | ~20 min | ~10 min | 11-12 min | **HIT** |

## Answers to Your Questions

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **Compression balance** | Training montage (6-13) at 16 slides is right. Not too deep. The pillars still land in the pivotal scenes. |
| **Multi-panel clarity** | Clear. Quad panels, triptychs, split panels — all well-specified. Gemini will understand. |
| **Pacing** | ~10 minutes is perfect for a cold open hook. Enough to invest, not enough to exhaust. |
| **EP2 connection** | Lands. Card → "watch world burn" → chessboard shadow → "agent of chaos" — clean handoff. |

## One Minor Fix

**Header metadata discrepancy:**

```
Line 6 says: Total Slides: 115
Actual count: 94
```

Update the header to reflect 94 slides before generation.

## Production Compliance

| Rule | Status |
|------|--------|
| ONE DIALOGUE PER SPEAKER | PASS |
| FULL CHARACTER BLOCKS | PASS |
| FULL BLEED | PASS |
| 16:9 ASPECT RATIO | PASS |
| DARK KNIGHT NOIR STYLE | PASS |
| MULTI-PANEL SPECIFICATIONS | PASS |

---

## Verdict

**Ready for image generation.**

Fix the header metadata. Then proceed.

Racy and deep. That's the cut.
