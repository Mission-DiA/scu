# EP2 THE TEST — SCREENPLAY SIGNED OFF

Simmons,

The Joker tested them all. The screenplay holds.

---

## Overall Assessment

**APPROVED for prompt development.**

---

## What I Verified

### Arc Continuity (EP1 → EP2)

| Element | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Joker card from EP1 ending | Opens EP2 on chessboard — CONNECTS |
| Ra's training flashback | Scene 6 — CONNECTS |
| Chessboard motif | Continues with colors — CONNECTS |
| Framework evolution | Experienced → Named — CLEAR |

### Four Choices Structure

| Choice | Pillar | Scene | Test | Status |
|--------|--------|-------|------|--------|
| #1 | CLARITY | 7-8 | Which crisis matters most? | CLEAR |
| #2 | COURAGE | 11-12 | Act despite uncertain outcome | CLEAR |
| #3 | COMMITMENT | 16-17 | Destroy Harvey to save the child | CLEAR |
| #4 | MOVEMENT | 20-22 | Become the villain to save the city | CLEAR |

Each choice tests its pillar. Structure works.

### Framework Naming

| Pillar | Caption | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| CLARITY | "Know what matters — even when everything is on fire." | IMPACTFUL |
| COURAGE | "Act before you're ready — the cost might break you." | IMPACTFUL |
| COMMITMENT | "Accept the cost you can't see." | IMPACTFUL |
| MOVEMENT | "Burn the bridge behind you." | IMPACTFUL |

**Key evolution from EP1:** Framework now NAMED, not just experienced. This is correct for EP2's purpose (during-event, explicit teaching).

### Joker Face-to-Face Moments

| Scene | Location | Type | Status |
|-------|----------|------|--------|
| 12 | GCPD Interrogation | Physical confrontation | LANDS |
| 13 | Hospital (Nurse) | Psychological corruption | LANDS |
| 26 | Arkham Asylum | Final prophecy | LANDS |

Three solid face-to-face moments. Joker is DOMINANT throughout.

### Famous Lines

| Line | Character | Status |
|------|-----------|--------|
| "Do I really look like a guy with a plan?" | Joker | PRESENT |
| "Tick tock, Batman." | Joker | PRESENT |
| "You made a choice. That makes you just like me." | Joker | PRESENT |
| "I'm not a monster. I'm just ahead of the curve." | Joker | PRESENT |
| "Madness is like gravity. All it takes is a little push." | Joker | PRESENT |
| "Some men just want to watch the world burn." | Alfred | PRESENT |
| "He's a silent guardian. A watchful protector. A Dark Knight." | Gordon | PRESENT |
| "The only morality in a cruel world is chance." | Two-Face | PRESENT |
| "When Gotham is ashes, you have my permission to die." | Bane | PRESENT |

All major lines accounted for.

### EP3 Setup (Bane Tease)

| Element | Scene | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| The Pit | 28 | CLEAR |
| Bane's mask | 28 | CLEAR |
| "Permission to die" | 28 | CLEAR |
| 8 years later | 28 | CLEAR |

Effective setup. The force antagonist is promised.

## Answers to Your Questions

## Production Notes for Prompts

When you move to prompts, remember:

1. **Apply v3 learnings:** 60-ish slides, 6-panel grids for montage
2. **Joker costume tracking:** Standard → Interrogation → Nurse → Straitjacket
3. **Two-Face transformation:** Scene 13 is the pivot — before/after must be clear
4. **Ferry scenes:** Both interiors needed — civilians and prisoners
5. **Bane tease:** Silhouette first, then mask close-up — build the reveal

---

## Verdict

**Ready for FULL DEPTH prompt development.**

Proceed to prompts. Apply v3 compression learnings from EP1.
