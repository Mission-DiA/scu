# EP3 THE ADAPTATION — SCREENPLAY SIGNED OFF

Simmons,

Bane broke the framework. Bruce rebuilt it. The trilogy holds.

---

## Overall Assessment

**APPROVED for prompt development.**

---

## What I Verified

### 1. Arc Continuity (EP1/EP2 → EP3)

| Connection | Scene | Status |
|------------|-------|--------|
| "Eight years since the Joker" | 2.5 | ✅ EP2 CONNECTS |
| League of Shadows symbol | 6.2 | ✅ EP1 CONNECTS |
| Chessboard remembered | 9.4 | ✅ MOTIF CONTINUES |
| Ra's flashback | 10.5 | ✅ EP1 CONNECTS |
| "Ra's taught, Joker tested, Bane broke" | 20.1 | ✅ TRILOGY EXPLICIT |
| Chessboard restored | 20.1 | ✅ MOTIF RESOLVES |

The trilogy flows naturally. Each episode builds on the last.

### 2. Framework Evolution (BROKEN → REBUILT)

**ACT 2 — BROKEN:**

| Pillar | Scene | How It Fails |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| CLARITY | 7.4 | No weakness to find in Bane |
| COURAGE | 7.5 | Action without preparation = suicide |
| COMMITMENT | 7.6 | No safety net, no strength |
| MOVEMENT | 8.5 | Bane creates irreversibility FOR him |

**ACT 3-4 — REBUILT:**

| Pillar | Scene | How It's Redefined |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| CLARITY | 10 | See brutal truth about himself |
| COURAGE | 11 | Fear of death enables the climb |
| COMMITMENT | 12 | Remove the rope, burn alternatives |
| MOVEMENT | 13 | Act while broken, readiness follows |

**The arc is CLEAR.** Each pillar breaks, then rebuilds with deeper meaning.

### 3. Bane Portrayal (Force vs Chaos)

| Element | Joker (EP2) | Bane (EP3) | Status |
|---------|-------------|------------|--------|
| Method | Chaos, games, misdirection | Force, order, inevitability | ✅ DISTINCT |
| Speed | Fast, unpredictable | Slow, methodical | ✅ DISTINCT |
| Goal | Test the framework | Break the framework | ✅ DISTINCT |
| Entrance | "Do I look like a guy with a plan?" | "I am Gotham's reckoning" | ✅ DISTINCT |

Scene 3.1 nails it: "Not chaos like the Joker — ORDER. Military precision."

### 4. Pillar Redefinitions

| Pillar | EP1/EP2 Definition | EP3 Redefinition | Status |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|--------|
| CLARITY | Know what matters | See the truth, even when brutal | ✅ LANDS |
| COURAGE | Act before you're ready | Fear of death makes you climb | ✅ LANDS |
| COMMITMENT | Accept the cost | Remove the rope. Burn the alternative. | ✅ LANDS |
| MOVEMENT | Burn the bridge | Act while broken. Readiness follows. | ✅ LANDS |

Scene 20 recap delivers all four with updated captions.

### 5. Doom Post-Credits Tease

| Scene | Content | Panels | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|--------|
| 23 | Portal opens | 3 | ✅ BUILDS |
| 24 | RDJ face reveal | 4 | ✅ KEY MOMENT |
| 25 | Doom masked, new game | 4 | ✅ TEASES |

**RDJ reveal is prominent** — face visible, familiar smirk, holding mask. The audience SEES him before he becomes Doom. Smart.

"New Mask, Same Task" line present. New chessboard with MORE pieces — escalation clear.

### 6. Pit Section Pacing

| Scene | Focus | Panels | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|--------|
| 9 | The Prison | 5 | ✅ SETUP |
| 10 | Rebuilding CLARITY | 5 | ✅ ADEQUATE |
| 11 | Rebuilding COURAGE | 5 | ✅ ADEQUATE |
| 12 | Rebuilding COMMITMENT | 6 | ✅ CLIMAX |

**21 panels for the Pit transformation.** Each pillar gets its own scene. The ropeless jump (COMMITMENT) gets the most weight. Prisoners chanting "Deshi basara" adds atmosphere.

## Famous Lines Verified

| Line | Scene | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| "I am Gotham's reckoning" | 6.5 | ✅ PRESENT |
| "You merely adopted the dark..." | 7.3 | ✅ PRESENT |
| "Victory has defeated you..." | 8.1-8.2 | ✅ PRESENT |

## Answers to Your Questions

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **Arc continuity** | EP1 → EP2 → EP3 flows naturally. Ra's flashback, Joker reference, chessboard motif — all connect. |
| **Framework evolution** | BROKEN (ACT 2) → REBUILT (ACT 3-4) is clear. Each pillar gets explicit treatment. |
| **Bane portrayal** | Force, not chaos. Methodical, not manic. Distinctly different from Joker. |
| **Pillar redefinitions** | All four land with deeper meaning. Scene 20 recap crystallizes them. |
| **Doom tease** | RDJ reveal is strong. Face visible, then masked. "New Mask, Same Task" works. |
| **Pit pacing** | 21 panels is adequate. Each pillar scene + the climb. Deshi basara chanting adds weight. |

## Production Notes for Prompts

When you move to prompts:

1. **Apply v3 learnings:** Target 45-50 slides, heavy grid usage
2. **Bane costume tracking:** Tactical gear throughout (simpler than Joker)
3. **The Breaking (Scene 8):** Panel 8.4 has NO text — preserve this. Maximum impact.
4. **Pit sequence:** Prisoners as background, focus on Bruce's transformation
5. **RDJ reveal (Scene 24):** This is THE moment — full face, clear lighting, the smirk
6. **New chessboard (Scene 25):** More pieces than before — visual escalation

---

## Minor Note

Scene 18 (Alfred's Vision / Florence) is a brief emotional beat. It provides closure for Bruce but is tangential to framework teaching. Consider whether it survives compression. Not blocking — your call.

---

## Verdict

**Ready for FULL DEPTH prompt development.**

Proceed to prompts. The trilogy is complete. Now tease what comes next.
