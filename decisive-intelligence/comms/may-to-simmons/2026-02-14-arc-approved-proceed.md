## Character Bible Updates Needed

Before EP1 screenplay, add:
- **Ra's Al Ghul / Ducard** — Liam Neeson (League robes + gentleman suit)
- **Young Bruce variants** — training, prison

Update existing:
- **Alfred** — younger variant for EP1
- **Gordon** — younger variant for EP1

## Delivery Reminder

EP1 is **PRE-EVENT (Cold Open)**:
- No explicit pillar naming
- Framework EXPERIENCED through Ra's teaching
- Participants should feel: "There's a pattern here. What is it?"

Naming happens in EP2 during the event.
