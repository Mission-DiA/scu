# EP1 THE FOUNDATION — Editorial Review

Simmons,

Strong work. You followed the direction well — 5 pivotal scenes, framework experienced not named, clean EP2 connection.

**One revision needed before sign-off.**

---

## Overall Assessment

**APPROVED WITH MINOR REVISION**

The screenplay is structurally sound. The "LEARN" phase lands properly.

---

## What Works

- **Five pivotal scenes clearly marked** — CLARITY (14), COURAGE (15-16), COMMITMENT (17), MOVEMENT (21), ALL FOUR (24)
- **Framework experienced, not named** — Participants will feel the pattern without labels
- **Ra's reveal is clear** — Scene 20 dialogue makes Ducard=Ra's explicit
- **Train fight applies all four pillars** — Student surpasses mentor with different moral compass
- **Joker tease lands** — Clean handoff to EP2
- **Character blocks included** — Ready for prompt development
- **Costume tracking correct** — Bruce and Ra's variations properly mapped

## Revision Needed

### Scene 26 — Caption/Piece Alignment Error

The closing sequence has captions OFFSET from the chess pieces they describe.

**Current (INCORRECT):**

| Panel | Piece Shown | Current Caption |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| 26.1 | Hand places Bishop | "Know what matters" |
| 26.2 | Knight (blue) | "Act before you're ready" |
| 26.3 | Queen (red) | "Commit fully" |
| 26.4 | Rook (white) | "Move forward. Burn the bridge." |
| 26.5 | Bishop (orange) | "That was the framework" |

**Required (CORRECT):**

Per SERIES.md pillar-to-piece mapping:
- Knight (blue) = CLARITY = "Know what matters"
- Queen (red) = COURAGE = "Act before you're ready"
- Rook (white) = COMMITMENT = "Commit fully"
- Bishop (orange) = MOVEMENT = "Move forward"

**Fix:**

| Panel | Piece Shown | Correct Caption |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| 26.1 | All four, hand places final | (no pillar caption — setup shot) |
| 26.2 | Knight (blue) | "Know what matters." |
| 26.3 | Queen (red) | "Act before you're ready." |
| 26.4 | Rook (white) | "Commit fully." |
| 26.5 | Bishop (orange) | "Move forward. Burn the bridge behind you." |
| 26.6 | Pull back, all four | "That was the framework." (keep as-is) |

## Responses to Your Specific Questions

### 1. Pacing: Do training scenes (6-13) move too slowly?

**No.** This is a "LEARN" episode — the philosophy IS the content. 43 panels of setup for 5 pivotal action payoffs is appropriate.

Minor note: Scenes 8-10 (12 panels combined) could be slightly tighter, but not critical.

### 2. Ra's reveal: Is Scene 20 clear enough?

**Yes.** The dialogue is explicit:
- "You didn't really think the League's leader would expose himself like that?"
- "The man you killed was a decoy. I am Ra's Al Ghul."

Non-comic readers will understand.

### 3. Framework experience: Do participants feel the pillars without naming?

**Yes.** Each pillar is EXPERIENCED through action:
- CLARITY → Blindfolded training, "Always mind your surroundings"
- COURAGE → Bat cave, "Master your own fear"
- COMMITMENT → Execution refusal, "The will to act is everything"
- MOVEMENT → Manor burns, forward is only direction

Scene 26 describes them without naming them. The "aha" is preserved for EP2.

### 4. Joker tease: Is Scene 25-26 sufficient?

**Yes.** Gordon's "Some men just want to watch the world burn" + Joker card on chessboard + "Now it would be tested by an agent of chaos" = clean handoff.
