## Villain Philosophy

### The Joker (EP1 + EP2)
**Threat Type:** Psychological warfare, chaos, misdirection

> "I'm an agent of chaos."
> "Why so serious?"
> "You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain."
> "Madness, as you know, is like gravity. All it takes is a little push."
> "Do I really look like a guy with a plan?"
> "It's not about the money. It's about sending a message."
> "You see, their morals, their code... it's a bad joke."
> "Let's put a smile on that face."
> "I believe whatever doesn't kill you simply makes you... stranger."

**Framework Challenge:** Joker attacks CLARITY by creating noise, misdirection, impossible choices.

### Bane (EP3)
**Threat Type:** Physical force, structural violence, patient inevitability

> "I am Gotham's reckoning."
> "You think darkness is your ally? You merely adopted the dark. I was born in it, molded by it."
> "When Gotham is ashes, you have my permission to die."
> "Peace has cost you your strength. Victory has defeated you."
> "I will break you."
> "The fire rises."
> "Theatricality and deception are powerful agents to the uninitiated. But we are initiated, aren't we, Bruce?"
> "It doesn't matter who we are. What matters is our plan."

**Framework Challenge:** Bane attacks the FOUNDATION — same framework, but applied under physical threat.

### Doctor Doom (Post-Credits)
**Threat Type:** Multiverse-level, unknown, reality-bending

> **"New Mask, Same Task."** — Robert Downey Jr., Comic Con 2024

**Framework Challenge:** Challenges come from universes you didn't know existed. The framework must be ready for the unknown.
