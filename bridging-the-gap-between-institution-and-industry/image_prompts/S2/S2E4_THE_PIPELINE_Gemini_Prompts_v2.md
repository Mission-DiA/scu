## MASTER REFERENCE (For Human Use Only — Not for Gemini)

### Episode Info
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Episode | S2E4 |
| Title | THE PIPELINE |
| Universe | DevOps |
| Primary Color | Orange (#F97316) |
| Total Slides | 24 (Cover + 22 Story + End Card) |
| Theme | One step ahead is enough to mentor |

### Character Casting
| Character | Actor | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|

### Key Context from S1E4
- Viktor was stuck/paralyzed during deployment freeze
- He's moved since then but still working through fears
- He tries to mentor Daisy but fumbles — good intentions, awkward delivery
- Coulson validates imperfect mentorship at the end

### Watermark Tiers
| Slide Type | Style | Specs |

### Production Rules Applied
- **ONE DIALOGUE PER SPEAKER PER PANEL** — Each character gets MAX one speech bubble per panel
- **LOCKED CHARACTER BLOCKS** — Complete specs in EVERY panel, no shortcuts
- **NO LAZY REFERENCES** — Even background, silhouette, fragment appearances need FULL character specs
- **NATURAL LANGUAGE** — Avoid technical jargon Gemini renders as text
