VISUAL COMPOSITION:

DAISY JOHNSON (ENGINEERING) FULL DESCRIPTION:
- Face & Body: Chloe Bennet, East Asian-American woman, late 20s, athletic build, 5'6"
- Hair: Shoulder-length dark brown hair worn COMPLETELY DOWN — loose, natural, free-flowing, no styling, hair framing her face and touching shoulders
- Costume: Heather grey (#9CA3AF) pullover hoodie over white (#FFFFFF) t-shirt, medium blue (#3B82F6) jeans, white (#FFFFFF) low-top sneakers
- Expression: Proud but surrounded by disconnected elements
- Action: Standing at center, arms slightly spread
- Position: Center of frame, full body visible

FLOATING ELEMENTS AROUND DAISY:
- Multiple floating notifications: "MERGED" "SHIPPED" "DEPLOYED" "PR APPROVED"
- Green (#00FF41) text on dark backgrounds
- The notifications are DISCONNECTED — not forming anything
- They float randomly, not building toward a structure

BACKGROUND:
- Faint D3O loop diagram visible but incomplete:
  - DESIGN → DEVELOP → DEPLOY → OPERATE
  - Only DEVELOP → DEPLOY is highlighted
  - The loop is BROKEN — doesn't connect back
- Dark tech environment with green (#00FF41) glow
- Cosmic edges with Watcher's silhouette faintly visible

---

CRITICAL:
• Image extends to all edges, no margins or borders
• SCU watermark bottom-left in red/gold, clearly visible
• Green (#00FF41) tint throughout — ENGINEERING UNIVERSE
• The floating PRs/notifications are DISCONNECTED — visual metaphor
• The incomplete loop diagram hints at the episode's lesson
• Title text clearly legible
