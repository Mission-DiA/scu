VISUAL COMPOSITION:

DAISY JOHNSON (PRIME) FULL DESCRIPTION:
- Face & Body: Chloe Bennet, East Asian-American woman, late 20s, athletic build, 5'6"
- Hair: Shoulder-length dark brown hair in HIGH PONYTAIL — pulled back and secured at MID-HEAD level, active/tactical style, completely off the face
- Costume: Black (#000000) SHIELD tactical suit (form-fitting, subtle SHIELD eagle logo on left shoulder), black (#000000) utility belt at waist, black (#000000) combat boots
- Expression: Contemplative, looking at the crossroads before her
- Action: Standing at center, facing a visual fork in the path
- Position: Center of frame, full body visible

CROSSROADS VISUAL:
- LEFT PATH: Stack of completed mission files and reports — disorganized pile, "MISSION COMPLETE" stamps, busy but directionless
- RIGHT PATH: A structured foundation being built brick by brick — organized, intentional, growing upward
- Daisy is looking toward the LEFT (the mission files) — she hasn't yet seen the better path

BACKGROUND:
- SHIELD Command Center environment
- Blue (#4A90D9) holographic glow throughout
- Cosmic edges with Watcher's silhouette faintly visible in upper corners
- Dark tactical aesthetic

---

CRITICAL:

• Title text clearly legible
