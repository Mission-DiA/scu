- **NO LAZY REFERENCES** — Even background, silhouette, fragment appearances need FULL character specs
- **AI AUTOMATION VISIBLE** — Show AI-powered testing tools in environment
- **NATURAL LANGUAGE** — Avoid technical jargon Gemini renders as text
- **SEATED/STANDING EXPLICIT** — Define character positions to avoid hallucination
