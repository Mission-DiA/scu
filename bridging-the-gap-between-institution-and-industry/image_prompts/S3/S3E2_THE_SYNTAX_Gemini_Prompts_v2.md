Create a FULL BLEED digital comic panel in Pixar-meets-MCU style at 16:9 aspect ratio (1920x1080px). The image must extend to ALL EDGES with NO outer margins, borders, or frames.

SCENE: The Watcher observes Engineering fragment, then turns toward QA Universe.

LAYOUT: Two panels (50% each) with 1-2 pixel thin white line between.

---

PANEL 1 (50% width, LEFT):
The Watcher observing the fading Engineering fragment with Daisy inside.

UATU THE WATCHER FULL DESCRIPTION:
- Face & Body: Massive humanoid with enlarged bald cranium, pale grey-blue skin, no visible ears, glowing white eyes, imposing godlike presence, 8+ feet tall
- Costume: Flowing white robes with subtle silver trim, cosmic star patterns woven into fabric, ethereal golden energy at edges
- Expression: Contemplative, satisfied
- Action: Observing fading green fragment
- Position: FOREGROUND RIGHT, waist-up framing

REALITY FRAGMENT (FADING — ENGINEERING UNIVERSE):
- Green (#00FF41) glowing fragment, edges beginning to dissolve
- D3O diagram visible in background within fragment

INSIDE THE FRAGMENT — ENGINEERING DAISY:
- Face & Body: Chloe Bennet, East Asian-American woman, late 20s, athletic build, 5'6"
- Hair: Shoulder-length dark brown hair worn COMPLETELY DOWN — loose, natural, free-flowing, hair framing her face
- Costume: Heather grey (#9CA3AF) pullover hoodie over white t-shirt
- Expression: Thoughtful, studying documentation
- Action: Seated at desk, looking at D3O diagram
- Position: Visible within the fragment, small but recognizable

ENVIRONMENT — COSMIC SPACE:
- Deep space with stars
- Fragment fading at edges

TEXT IN THIS PANEL:
- CAPTION BOX (dark blue #1a1a4e fill, white text): "In this universe, she learned that syntax is merely the alphabet. That code without context is poetry without meaning."
- Position: Top of panel

---

PANEL 2 (50% width, RIGHT):
The Watcher turns toward new purple fragment — QA Universe forming with QA Daisy inside.

UATU THE WATCHER FULL DESCRIPTION:
- Face & Body: Massive humanoid with enlarged bald cranium, pale grey-blue skin, no visible ears, glowing white eyes, imposing godlike presence, 8+ feet tall
- Costume: Flowing white robes with subtle silver trim, cosmic star patterns woven into fabric
- Expression: Intrigued, turning toward new story
- Action: Turning gaze toward purple fragment
- Position: FOREGROUND LEFT, waist-up framing

NEW REALITY FRAGMENT (FORMING — QA UNIVERSE):
- Purple (#8B5CF6) glowing fragment, edges crystallizing into shape
- Test dashboards and QA metrics visible in background

INSIDE THE FRAGMENT — QA DAISY:
- Face & Body: Chloe Bennet, East Asian-American woman, late 20s, athletic build, 5'6"
- Hair: Shoulder-length dark brown hair in HALF-UP style — top section pulled back and secured, bottom half loose and flowing past shoulders
- Costume: Navy blue (#1E3A5F) blazer over white (#FFFFFF) blouse, professional QA lead appearance
- Expression: Focused, reviewing test results
- Action: Standing at QA dashboard
- Position: Visible within the fragment, small but recognizable — DIFFERENT from Engineering Daisy (different hair, different clothes)

ENVIRONMENT — COSMIC SPACE:
- Deep space with stars
- Transition from green to purple energy

TEXT IN THIS PANEL:
- CAPTION BOX (dark blue #1a1a4e fill, white text): "But the lesson echoes further. In another reality, a different alphabet awaits... where passing tests is not the same as finding truth."
- Position: Bottom of panel

---

STYLE REQUIREMENTS:
- Pixar-level 3D rendering with cosmic aesthetic
- Transition from green (Engineering) to purple (QA) fragments
- Sense of continuing journey
- TWO DIFFERENT DAISYS clearly distinguishable — hair is the key differentiator

SCU WATERMARK: Add subtle "SCU" text in bottom-left corner, white color, 2% of image width, 30% opacity.

---

CRITICAL:
- FULL BLEED — image extends to all edges, NO margins
- Clear transition from Engineering (green) to QA (purple)
- Engineering Daisy: HAIR COMPLETELY DOWN, grey hoodie
- QA Daisy: HAIR HALF-UP, navy blazer
- Both Daisys must be clearly recognizable within their fragments
- ONE caption per panel
```

## SLIDE 14: END CARD

```

• Color: Deep red (#8B0000) with gold (#FFD700) outline/glow
• Size: 3% of image width
• Opacity: Clearly visible, part of the design

=========================================

---

BACKGROUND:
- Deep space cosmic background
- Green (#00FF41) Engineering Universe color as accent glow
- Code fragments floating like digital stars
- D3O diagram ghosted in background

TEXT ELEMENTS (arranged top to bottom, centered):

1. "SWAMI CINEMATIC UNIVERSE"
   — Red (#CC0000) with gold (#FFD700) accents, MCU style, LARGEST

5. "In collaboration with Claude Code & Google Gemini"
   — Light grey (#999999), smallest

---

STYLE REQUIREMENTS:
- Cinematic end card aesthetic
- Professional, polished appearance

## PRODUCTION NOTES

### Slide Count Summary
| Type | Count |
|------|-------|
| Cover | 1 |
| Story Panels | 13 |
| End Card | 1 |
| **Total** | **15** |

### S.P. Easter Eggs
1. **Slide 04** — Marcus's Slack status: "@sp: The code isn't the system. The system isn't the code."
2. **Slide 08** — Whiteboard corner: "@sp: The code isn't the system."

### Key Visual Moments
1. **Slide 03** — Pride moment (merge)
