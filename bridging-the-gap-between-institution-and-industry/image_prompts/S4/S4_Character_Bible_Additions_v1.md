## CHARACTER PHILOSOPHY

### Melinda May

**Teaching Style:** Silent example. She doesn't lecture — she states facts. Her few words carry the weight of decades.

**Core Wisdom:** "Consequences are not negotiable."

**Visual Language:**
- Always positioned with awareness of exits and threats
- Economy of movement — no wasted gesture
- Eyes always observing, even in conversation

**Relationship to Daisy:** Respected veteran. May sees Daisy's potential. Offers truth, not comfort.

---

### Maria Hill

**Teaching Style:** Organizational perspective. She helps Daisy understand that choices ripple outward.

**Core Wisdom:** "Your choices become other people's constraints."

**Visual Language:**
- Professional posture, commanding presence
- Often holding tablet or reviewing reports
- Direct eye contact when speaking

**Relationship to Daisy:** Professional oversight. Hill evaluates Daisy's judgment, not just her skills.

---

### Elena

**Teaching Style:** Quality as philosophy, not process. She asks questions that reveal assumptions.

**Core Wisdom:** "Quality isn't a phase. It's a decision you make before you write the first line."

**Visual Language:**
- Precise gestures, deliberate movement
- Often near whiteboards or dashboards
- Observes before speaking

**Relationship to Daisy:** Quality mentor. Elena has built what Daisy wants to build. She shows the path, not just the destination.
