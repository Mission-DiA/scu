# TROUBLESHOOTING NOTES

## If Paul Giamatti Doesn't Render Correctly:
- "Paul Giamatti, the American actor known for Sideways and Billions"

- "Appears faded, washed out, like an old photograph"

## If Watermark Is Missing:
- Story slides: "Add subtle 'SCU' text, white, 30% opacity, bottom-left"
- Bookends: "Add 'SCU' text, red with gold outline, bottom-left"
