## KEY ENVIRONMENT BLOCKS

### DEVOPS UNIVERSE ENVIRONMENT (Use in ALL slides)
```

- Orange (#F97316) is the PRIMARY UNIVERSE COLOR — walls, floor, and atmosphere are tinted orange
- Dark grey/black surfaces bathed in orange terminal light from all monitors
- The overall atmosphere is ORANGE — this identifies the DevOps Universe
- NO bright white lighting, NO daylight, NO neutral lighting — dark room with ORANGE glow only
- NO desks, NO chairs, NO coffee cups, NO plants, NO extra props
```

### LARGE DISPLAY BOARD (Slides 06-11)
```
LARGE DIGITAL DISPLAY (DARK MODE) — GITOPS + KUBERNETES ARCHITECTURE:
- Wall-mounted screen, approximately 65-inch display
- DARK MODE: Dark grey (#1F2937) background
- Header: "GITOPS DEPLOYMENT PIPELINE v2.0" in white (#FFFFFF), "Designed by D. Johnson | Kubernetes + ArgoCD" in grey (#9CA3AF), "# SP's first rule: Do it YOUR way." in green (#22C55E) — THIS IS THE S.P. EASTER EGG
- LEFT SECTION: Three Git repositories (app-source, k8s-manifests, helm-charts) with purple (#8B5CF6) accent, showing branch names and commit hashes
- CENTER SECTION: CI/CD pipeline flow (BUILD → TEST → SCAN → PUSH) in orange (#F97316), with ArgoCD sync status in cyan (#06B6D4) below
- BOTTOM SECTION: Three Kubernetes clusters side by side:
  - DEV-CLUSTER (blue #3B82F6): namespace, deployment, service, ingress, pods 2/2
  - STG-CLUSTER (yellow #F59E0B): namespace, deployment, service, ingress, pods 3/3
  - PROD-CLUSTER (green #22C55E): namespace, deployment, service, ingress, pods 5/5
  - Each cluster shows: version number, rollback version, health percentage

- All text LIGHT colored on DARK background
```

### MAIN DEPLOYMENT TERMINAL (Slides 13-16)

STYLE REQUIREMENTS:
- Pixar-level 3D rendering with tech workplace aesthetic
- DEVOPS UNIVERSE LIGHTING: Dominant ORANGE (#F97316) ambient glow throughout
- Emotional isolation — Daisy separate from the group
- Her pipeline diagram should still be visible on her screen (the answer no one will take)
- Robotic, repetitive energy from background engineers
- Orange tints all surfaces

SCU WATERMARK: Add subtle "SCU" text in bottom-left corner, white color, 2% of image width, 30% opacity.

---

CRITICAL:
- FULL BLEED — image extends to all edges, NO margins or borders
- DEVOPS UNIVERSE = ORANGE (#F97316) — the entire scene bathed in orange ambient glow
- Thought bubble has cloud-like edges (NOT pointed tail)
- Caption box is narrator voice — NOT character speech
- Daisy's isolation should be palpable even in a room full of people
- Her pipeline diagram visible on screen — she has the solution
- The thought bubble trails off "Why won't anyone..." (incomplete thought)

FADING DEVOPS FRAGMENT:
- The ORANGE (#F97316) DevOps fragment visible but fading/shrinking in background
- Transitioning out as the RED fragment takes focus

ENVIRONMENT:
- Deep cosmic void with swirling galaxies in dark blue (#1a1a4e) and purple (#4c1d95)
- Stars and nebulae in background
- RED (#EF4444) tinted fragment emerging, becoming prominent
- ORANGE (#F97316) fragment fading in background
- Ethereal energy shifting from orange to red
- Tension building in the cosmic atmosphere

TEXT IN THIS PANEL:
- CAPTION BOX (top, dark blue #1a1a4e background, white text): "But what happens when the choice isn't yours to make slowly?"
- CAPTION BOX (bottom, dark blue #1a1a4e background, white text): "What if the universe decides to ask the question for you?"
- Position: Top and bottom of panel
- DO NOT include text from other panels.

---

STYLE REQUIREMENTS:
- Pixar-level 3D rendering with MCU cosmic aesthetic
- Panel 1: Watcher MASSIVE, ORANGE DevOps fragment with Daisy visible inside, cage shadows FADING
- Panel 2: RED (#EF4444) SRE fragment emerging with crisis atmosphere — alarm lights, urgency
- Cosmic void with deep blues (#1a1a4e) and purples (#4c1d95) as backdrop
- Clear visual transition: ORANGE (resolution, calm) → RED (crisis, tension)
- Daisy must be recognizable inside the DevOps fragment with correct costume
- Watcher's scale emphasizes his godlike observer role

SCU WATERMARK: Add subtle "SCU" text in bottom-left corner, white color, 2% of image width, 30% opacity.

---

CRITICAL:
- FULL BLEED — image extends to all edges, NO margins or borders
- Only 1-2 pixel thin white lines between panels
- Complete character descriptions in EVERY panel — including Daisy inside the reality fragment
- DAISY'S COSTUME inside fragment: Black (#000000) zip-up hoodie, charcoal (#1F2937) t-shirt, dark indigo (#1E1B4B) jeans, black (#000000) ankle boots, black smart watch
- Caption boxes for narrator voice — NOT speech bubbles
- TEXT IN THIS PANEL ONLY — do not duplicate text across panels
- Watcher is MASSIVE compared to the reality fragments
- Panel 1: ORANGE (#F97316) fragment, Daisy visible at center, cage shadows FADING — resolution
- Panel 2: RED (#EF4444) alert indicators, crisis atmosphere — teasing E5 SRE
- Clear color transition: ORANGE (DevOps, calm) → RED (SRE, crisis)
- The cage metaphor resolves in Panel 1 — shadows dissolving, door was always open
- E5 tease in Panel 2 — what happens when you don't have time to choose?
