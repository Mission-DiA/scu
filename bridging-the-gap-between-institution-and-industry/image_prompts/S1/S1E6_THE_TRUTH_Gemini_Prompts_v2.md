- Web browsers showing manual test checklists
- Warm but DIM lighting
- "SENIOR QA LEAD" nameplate visible
- Feels safe, familiar, but SMALLER
- **COULSON STANDS HERE** — on the comfort side she's LEAVING

CENTER — DAISY:
- Walking from LEFT to RIGHT
- Moving AWAY from manual testing, TOWARD automation
- Back partially toward Coulson (she's leaving that world behind)

RIGHT SIDE — GROWTH (Automation):
- Automation testing setup — code screens, test scripts running
- AI-powered testing dashboard visible
- BRIGHTER, more vibrant lighting
- Door marked "AUTOMATION" or abstract growth symbols
- Feels challenging but EXPANSIVE
- **NO ONE STANDS HERE** — she walks toward the path alone, her choice

BEHIND DAISY — GHOSTLY PAST VERSIONS:
- 3-4 translucent/ghostly versions of herself at different career stages
- All ghost versions are turned AWAY from the automation path
- 30-40% opacity, faded, representing years of avoidance
- Visual history of hesitation

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- FULL BLEED — image extends to ALL edges
- Panel divider: 1-2 pixel thin white line ONLY

  - He watches Daisy walk AWAY from him, TOWARD automation
  - Arms crossed, approving nod — supportive but NOT beckoning
  - She is walking AWAY from Coulson, not TOWARD him

  - The automation path (RIGHT side) has NO person standing there
  - Daisy walks toward the PATH, not toward a person
  - Her choice, her step, alone
- Purple (#8B5CF6) tint/lighting throughout
