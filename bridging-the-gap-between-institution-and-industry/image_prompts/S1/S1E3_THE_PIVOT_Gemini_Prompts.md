VISUAL COMPOSITION:

DAISY AT CENTER — standing at a literal fork in the QA lab:
• Face & Body: Chloe Bennet, East Asian-American woman, late 20s, athletic build, 5'6"
• Hair: Below shoulder-length dark brown, half-up professional style
• Costume: Dark blazer over light t-shirt, dark pants
• Expression: Uncertain, contemplating both paths
• Position: Center frame, facing the fork

PATH ONE (LEFT) — COMFORT:
• Manual testing setup — clipboards, physical smartphones and tablets for testing
• Web browsers open on screens showing manual test checklists
• Warm but dim lighting
• "SENIOR QA LEAD" nameplate visible
• Feels safe, familiar, smaller

PATH TWO (RIGHT) — GROWTH:
• Automation testing setup — code screens, test scripts running
• AI-powered testing dashboard visible
• Brighter, more vibrant lighting
• Door marked with abstract symbols suggesting "unknown"
• Feels challenging, uncertain, expansive

BEHIND DAISY:
• Ghostly/translucent versions of herself at different career stages
• All the ghost versions are turned AWAY from the automation path
• Visual history of avoidance

COSMIC EDGES:
• Watcher's silhouette faintly visible in upper corners
• Purple cosmic energy framing the scene
• Stars and nebulae suggesting multiverse

TEXT ELEMENTS:
• Top center: "WHAT IF...?" in bold MCU-style font
• Center: "SEASON 1, EPISODE 3"
• Below center: "THE PIVOT"
• All text: White with subtle purple glow

ENVIRONMENT:
• QA testing lab with purple-tinted lighting (#8B5CF6 at 20%)

• BUT shown PULLING AWAY from the ladder
