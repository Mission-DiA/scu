# SCU — LOCKED CHARACTER BLOCKS
## Copy-Paste Reference for All Universes
### Version 2.0 | January 2026

---

## USAGE — CRITICAL RULES

### Rule: NO LAZY REFERENCES

Copy the COMPLETE block for each character into EVERY panel where they appear.

**This applies to ALL visibility levels:**
| Scenario | Still Needs Full Description? |
|----------|------------------------------|
| Character in foreground | ✓ YES |
| Character in background | ✓ YES |
| Character as silhouette | ✓ YES |
| Character in universe fragment/bubble | ✓ YES |
| Character in reflection | ✓ YES |
| Character in photo on desk | ✓ YES |
| Character partially visible | ✓ YES |

**Lazy References to AVOID:**
- ✗ "Daisy's silhouette visible working"
- ✗ "Coulson visible in background"
- ✗ "Daisy visible within, working"
- ✗ "Viktor trying to help someone"
- ✗ "same as Panel 1"
- ✗ "Daisy (as before)"

**Why This Matters:** Gemini treats each panel as fresh context. It cannot infer character details from earlier panels or from this document header.

### Rule: SEATED/STANDING EXPLICIT

Always specify SEATED or STANDING in the Position field:
- `Position: SEATED in office chair, facing monitors`
- `Position: STANDING beside desk, looking at screen`
- `Position: SITTING DOWN (pulling up chair)`
- `Position: STANDING UP to leave`
