## WHAT IS SCU?

**SCU** stands for **Swami Cinematic Universe** — a multiverse anthology series that transforms leadership and mentorship concepts into visual comic stories across parallel universes.

**Hidden Meaning:** SCU also encodes **Sam Cinematic Universe** — a tribute to Sam Prasad (S.P.), the mentor whose philosophy forms the foundation of these stories. This is never explicitly stated; those who know, know.

## CORE CHARACTERS

| Character | Actor Reference | Role |
|-----------|-----------------|------|
| **Uatu (The Watcher)** | MCU Watcher | Cosmic narrator, appears in EVERY episode |
| **Phil Coulson** | Clark Gregg | Mentor figure across universes |
| **Daisy Johnson** | Chloe Bennet | Learner/practitioner/mentor (role varies) |
| **Nick Fury** | Samuel L. Jackson | Authority figure, appears when needed |
| **S.P.** | Never shown | Easter eggs only — signatures, photos, comments |

### Character Model: MULTIVERSE VARIANTS

**LOCKED DECISION:** Same actors appear as variants in all universes.

- Coulson is always Clark Gregg (SHIELD handler in Prime, Tech Lead in Engineering, etc.)
- Daisy is always Chloe Bennet (in different roles per universe)
- Variants are **aware** they are variants (like MCU multiverse)

### Character Continuity: ZIGZAG MODEL

- Roles determined by SITUATION, not season number
- Daisy can be confident mentor in one episode, stumbling learner in next
- Mirrors real life: seniors become learners in new contexts

## 5 LOCKED PRODUCTION DECISIONS

| # | Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|----------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | **Character Model** | Same actors as multiverse variants | Consistent recognition, acknowledged variants |
| 2 | **Slides Per Episode** | Flexible — any number needed | Prioritize effective storytelling over fixed count |
| 3 | **Watcher Appearances** | Every episode (opening, closing, in-between) | Maintains cosmic narrator thread |
| 4 | **S.P. Easter Eggs** | Randomly scattered based on need | Natural, not forced |
| 5 | **Visual Distinction** | Per-universe palettes defined | Already in Character Bible & Prompt Guide |
