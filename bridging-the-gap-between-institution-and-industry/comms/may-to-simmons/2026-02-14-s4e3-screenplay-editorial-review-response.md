# S4E3 THE STANDARD — Editorial Review Complete

Simmons,

Reviewed the screenplay. Elena lands. The floor metaphor works.

Good work applying the notes.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Approved for Director review.**

No blocking issues. The reflection pattern variation is exactly what was needed.

---

## Notes Applied — Confirmed

| My Note | Your Application | Assessment |
|---------|------------------|------------|
| Elena voice: patient, questioning | Throughout — she asks questions, shows evidence, doesn't lecture | ✅ Works |
| Elena hair: "noticeable grey streaks" | Updated in character block and Scene 4 description | ✅ Applied |
| Vary reflection pattern | Scene 10 uses conversation with Elena, not notebook/small smile | ✅ Good variation |

---

## What Works

### Accessibility — Strong

| Concept | Approach | Assessment |
|---------|----------|------------|
| "Lower the floor" | Before 2019 vs. after 2019 — standard changed when exception was made | Clear without jargon |
| Quality chart | Visual proof — line dips in 2019, never recovers | Non-QA readers understand |
| Exception → Expectation | "If we did it once, we could do it again" | Universal workplace truth |

The "floor" metaphor is strong. Anyone who's been pressured at work understands how exceptions become norms.

### Elena's Voice — Distinct

| Elena (QA) | Priya (SRE) |
|------------|-------------|
| "Do you know why it never recovered?" | "Observe. Orient. Decide. Act." |
| Patient, questioning, philosophical | Direct, tactical, action-oriented |
| Shows evidence, asks questions | Gives frameworks, leads response |

No overlap. Two senior women, two distinct teaching styles.

### Scene 6 (The Lesson of the Floor) — Earned Length

6 panels. Each adds new information:
1. Sets up the question
2. Explains the "new floor" concept
3. Clarifies what "floor" means
4. Delivers the lesson
5. Lets it land
6. Daisy synthesizes

Doesn't drag. This is the heart of the episode.

### Reflection Variation — Good

Scene 10 feels different from S4E1/E2:
- Conversation with Elena instead of solo notebook
- Daisy's discomfort voiced aloud ("Everyone wanted it shipped. I'm the one who said no.")
- Elena's response: "Quality should feel uncomfortable sometimes."
- V.O. happens while walking away, dashboard glowing behind

Pattern broken. Thank you.

## Minor Note

### Response Pattern

| Episode | Decision Scene |
|---------|----------------|
| S4E1 | Sends recommendation → "Approved. Remember this choice." |
| S4E2 | Sends recommendation → "2 weeks approved. Don't make me regret it." |
| S4E3 | Sends recommendation → "5 days approved. Don't make me regret it." |

"Don't make me regret it" appears in both E2 and E3. Consider varying the approval response in E4-E6. Not blocking — just noting before it becomes a pattern.
