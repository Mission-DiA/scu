# S4E1 THE PRINCIPLE — Editorial Review Complete

Simmons,

Reviewed the screenplay. Strong work. The principle lands.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Approved for Director review.**

No blocking issues. Minor notes below for your awareness during prompt development.

## What Works

### Character Voices — Distinct and Effective

| Character | Voice | Assessment |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| **May** | Terse, field truth, no lectures | Perfect. "I once took the fast route. Saved six hours. Cost two agents." — Maximum impact, minimum words. |
| **Hill** | Organizational, evaluative | Distinct from May. "I'm not asking what you COULD do. I'm asking what you SHOULD do." — Shifts frame from capability to judgment. |
| **Coulson** | Relational, guiding | Not telling, showing how to choose. "If this goes wrong, can I live with the trade-off I made?" — Mentor, not lecturer. |

All three are clearly differentiated. No overlap.

### Thematic Clarity

- The "principle vs. expedience" choice is clear without being preachy
- Alpha vs. Beta is a concrete decision — readers understand the stakes
- The lesson builds through encounter (May), challenge (Hill), guidance (Coulson), choice (Daisy)
- Not a lecture — a journey

### Continuity

| Element | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Prague extraction (S3E1) | ✅ Referenced correctly |
| "Real education begins" (S3E6) | ✅ Referenced correctly |
| May's line from Phase A | ✅ Exact match |
| Hill's question from Phase A | ✅ Exact match |
| Coulson's guidance from Phase A | ✅ Exact match |
| S.P. Easter egg | ✅ "Foundation Review: S.P." in Scene 10 |

### Accessibility

- Watcher opening explains foundation theme — no prior knowledge needed
- Prague context briefly established for new readers
- Alpha vs. Beta choice accessible to non-tactical readers
- Memorial wall concept self-explanatory

## Minor Notes for Prompt Phase

### Pacing Observation

| Concern | Scenes | Recommendation |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| Consecutive same-location scenes | Scenes 7, 8, 9 (all at memorial wall/hallway) | During prompts, vary camera angles and lighting to avoid visual repetition. Scene 7 could be tighter framing; Scenes 8-9 can pull back. |
| Scene 12 redundancy | Scene 12 (Daisy's quarters) | The lesson already landed in Scenes 9-10. Consider limiting Scene 12 to 2 panels, or cutting the notebook writing (we already saw her internalize). Optional — not blocking. |

### Production Rule Reminders

| Rule | Note for Prompts |
|------|------------------|
| SEATED/STANDING | Not always explicit in screenplay. During prompts, specify clearly: Hill seated at review table, Coulson/Daisy standing at memorial wall, etc. |
| Hill's tablet | Allowed per Character Bible — keep it consistent in her appearances. |
