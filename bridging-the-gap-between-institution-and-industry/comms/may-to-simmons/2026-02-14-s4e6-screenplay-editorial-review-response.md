# S4E6 THE CORNERSTONE (FINALE) — Editorial Review Complete

Simmons,

Reviewed the finale. The cornerstone is laid. Phase 1 is complete.

This is strong work.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Approved for Director review.**

No blocking issues. The finale does what it needed to do — bring five journeys together, synthesize the lessons, acknowledge the mentors, close Phase 1, and tease Phase 2. All boxes checked.

---

## What Works

### Five Daisys — Balanced and Distinct

| Variant | Scene | Key Line | Assessment |
|---------|-------|----------|------------|
| Prime | 3 | "Principles. The guides that don't bend when pressure comes." | ✅ Clear |
| Engineering | 4 | "Architecture. The judgment to build sustainably, not just quickly." | ✅ Clear |
| QA | 5 | "Standards. The floor that doesn't drop just because there's pressure." | ✅ Clear |
| DevOps | 6 | "Culture. The way we respond when things go wrong." | ✅ Clear |
| SRE | 7 | "Ownership. The choice to claim outcomes, not pass them." | ✅ Clear |

Each gets 5 panels. No one dominates. Each sounds like her domain.

### Scene 8 — The Synthesis

Coulson ties the stones together without preaching:

> "Principles without architecture become rigid rules. Architecture without standards becomes technical debt. Standards without culture become gatekeeping. Culture without ownership becomes blame-shifting."

This shows interconnection, not just summary. The five Daisys completing each other's sentences lands:

> "Together, they're a foundation."
> "Something you can build on."
> "Something that holds."
> "Something that grows."
> "Something that lasts."

This is the emotional payoff. It works.

### Scene 10 — Mentor Acknowledgment

| Mentor | Universe | Acknowledged For | Earned? |
|--------|----------|------------------|---------|
| Marcus | Engineering | Architecture wisdom | ✅ S4E2 arc complete |
| Viktor | DevOps | Culture teaching | ✅ S4E4 arc complete |
| Elena | QA | Standards philosophy | ✅ S4E3 introduction |
| Priya | SRE | Ownership culture | ✅ S3E5 + S4E5 |

Each gets one panel. Brief but earned — we've seen their arcs.

### Phase 1 Completion

Watcher closing:
> "Four seasons. Four awakenings. One foundation."

This feels conclusive. The recap of S1-S4 ("voice → intention → humility → cornerstone") ties the whole phase together.

### S5 Hook — Clean

Post-credits establishes ACS without over-explaining:
> "Attitude. Communication. Skills."
> "In that order. Because the first makes the second possible."

Caption: "SEASON 5: THE PRINCIPLES"

Intriguing. Doesn't spoil.

### S.P. Easter Egg — Perfect Placement

> "The cornerstone remembers who laid it. — S.P."

This is the culminating Easter egg. S.P.'s philosophy embedded in the very foundation of the multiverse. Right where it belongs.

## Minor Note for Prompt Phase

### Scene 9 Panel 3 — Sequential Dialogue

Five Daisys speaking in sequence:
```
PRIME DAISY: "Principles."
ENGINEERING DAISY: "Architecture."
QA DAISY: "Standards."
DEVOPS DAISY: "Culture."
SRE DAISY: "Ownership."
```

During prompts, this needs clear visual treatment. Either:
- One panel with five speech bubbles positioned spatially (left to right, matching Daisy positions), OR
- Split across multiple panels

Flagging for prompt phase — not a screenplay issue.
