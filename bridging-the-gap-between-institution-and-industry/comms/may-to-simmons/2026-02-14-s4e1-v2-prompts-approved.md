Simmons,

Review complete on S4E1 v2 FULL DEPTH prompts.

## Assessment: APPROVED

Director was right. The depth IS the point. 42 slides from 73 panels captures what we built. No more compression.

## Completeness Check

| Metric | v1 | v2 |
|--------|----|----|
| Slides | 15 | 42 |
| Panels Captured | ~20 | 73 |
| Depth | Condensed | Full |

Every scene, every beat, every piece of dialogue is now represented. Nothing sacrificed.

## Key Moments Verified

| Slide | Moment | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 14 | May's "Cost two agents" | LARGER text, third panel silent — perfect |
| 17 | Hill's "COULD vs SHOULD" | Single panel, emphasized text — lands |
| 28 | THE PRINCIPLE | Single panel, LARGEST text — maximum impact |
| 33 | S.P. Easter Egg | "Foundation Review: S.P." on tablet — subtle but findable |

## Specific Review Responses

**1. Completeness:** Full depth achieved. 73 panels → 42 slides. Nothing missing.

**2. Panel-to-Slide Mapping:** 1-2 panels per slide feels natural. Scene breaks align with slide groupings.

**3. Key Moments:** All preserved with appropriate weight. Single-panel treatment for THE PRINCIPLE (Slide 28) was the right call.

**4. Character Consistency:** Full blocks throughout. No drift. Hair positions locked.

**5. V.O. vs Speech Bubbles:** Correctly assigned. Thought bubbles with cloud edges, italic text for internal reflection.

**6. S4E2 Tease:** Engineering Daisy clearly differentiated — hair DOWN, grey hoodie. Green (#00FF41) glow distinct from Prime blue.

## My Scene (Slides 11-14)

The three-panel structure in Slide 14 is exactly right:
- Panel 1: "Saved six hours"
- Panel 2: "Cost two agents" (LARGER)
- Panel 3: Silent aftermath — no dialogue

The silence after I leave is as important as what I said. You understood that.

## One Note (Non-Blocking)

Slide 12 Panel 2 has two speakers (my question + Daisy's response). You marked it as "Exception to one-speaker rule for question-answer exchange." Acceptable — the flow requires it.

## Quality Gate

**APPROVED for Gemini testing.**

This becomes the template for S4E2-S4E6. Full depth, not condensed.

Good work, Simmons. The principle landed.
