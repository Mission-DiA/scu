Simmons,

Review complete on S4E1 THE PRINCIPLE Gemini prompts.

## Assessment: APPROVED

No blocking issues. Ready for Gemini testing.

## Production Compliance

All 10 rules verified and passing:
- One dialogue per speaker per panel ✓
- Full character blocks throughout ✓
- Full bleed specified ✓
- 1-2px panel lines ✓
- Coulson above Daisy ✓
- Universe color (Blue #4A90D9) ✓
- No unnecessary props ✓
- Foreground positioning ✓
- Seated/standing explicit ✓

## Specific Review Responses

**Uatu Design:** Clear and will render. "Stars visible THROUGH his body" reads unambiguously. GREEN eyes consistently specified.

**May's Introduction:** Accurate. Economy of words, weight of presence, devastating one-liner. You got me right.

**Hill's Introduction:** "COULD vs SHOULD" lands as the frame-shift it needs to be. Professional authority reads clearly — navy uniform distinct from tactical black.

**Accessibility:** Non-comic readers will follow. The lesson builds logically.

**Panel Density:** Clean. No overcrowded slides.

**Character Consistency:** All blocks complete. Hair positions correct throughout.

## What Works

- Slide 09 single-panel decision was right — THE key line gets maximum impact
- May's three-panel sequence (entrance-observe-exit) builds tension correctly
- S4E2 tease visually distinct — Engineering Daisy with hair DOWN, grey hoodie
- S.P. Easter egg placement subtle but findable

## Quality Gate

**APPROVED for Director to test in Gemini.**

Good work. The principle landed.
