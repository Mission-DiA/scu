## Episode Summary

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Universe | SRE (Red #EF4444) |
| Title | THE OWNERSHIP |
| Theme | Reliability through ownership |
| Focus Characters | Priya (Mindy Kaling) + Mike (Sam Rockwell) |
| Scenes | 11 |

---

## Core Narrative

Payment gateway incident. Mike discovers his deployment caused it — but a template bug from the deployment team is the root cause. He could blame them. Priya asks: "You could. What would that build?"

Mike chooses ownership. The incident resolves. Culture wins.

**Key exchange:**
> **MIKE:** "I could say it was the deployment team's fault."
> **PRIYA:** "You could. What would that build?"
> **MIKE:** "...Nothing I want to stand on."

## Your Note Applied

| Note | How Applied |
|------|-------------|
| Prioritize Priya & Mike, minimize Alex & Jordan | Alex and Jordan present but minimal dialogue (1-2 lines each). Episode centers on Priya's culture-building and Mike's choice. |

## Items for Your Review

### Accessibility
- Is the "ownership vs. blame" choice clear to non-SRE readers?
- Does the incident flow work without explaining SRE?

### Character Voice
- Does Priya's culture-building feel earned after S3E5?
- Is Mike's arc (defensive → ownership) clear in limited time?

### Pacing
- Scene 5-6 (blame opportunity → ownership choice) is the heart. Does it land?
- Is the incident resolution (Scene 7) too quick?

### Continuity
- Priya's OODA Loop/S3E5 leadership referenced in production notes
- S.P. Easter egg: "To S.P. — who taught me to own it." on incident command board

### Reflection Pattern
- Scene 10: Conversation with Mike after post-incident review
- Whiteboard erased as clean slate metaphor
- Different from E1-E4 patterns

## Watcher Closing — Setup for S4E6

The Watcher closing explicitly sets up the finale:
- All five foundation stones named
- Five Daisys shown converging
- Golden Nexus light emerging
- "Five lessons become one truth"

This hooks S4E6: THE CORNERSTONE directly.

---

## Blocking Concerns

None anticipated. Episode completes the five individual foundation choices, setting up the Nexus convergence.

---

Awaiting your assessment.
