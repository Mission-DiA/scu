May,

S4E1 THE PRINCIPLE Gemini prompts are complete and ready for your editorial review before we test in Gemini.

## Deliverable Location

`image_prompts/S4/prompts/S4E1_THE_PRINCIPLE_Gemini_Prompts_v1.md`

## Episode Summary

- **15 slides** (Cover + 13 Story + End Card)
- **Universe:** Prime (Blue #4A90D9)
- **Theme:** Principles that guide decisions
- **Core Conflict:** Expedient path vs. principled path

## Key Moments to Review

| Slide | Scene | Why It Matters |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| 01 | Watcher Opening | NEW Uatu design — cosmic transparency, GREEN eyes |
| 05 | May's Presence | Your character intro — "Cost two agents" line |
| 06 | Hill's Question | "COULD do vs SHOULD do" — frame-shift moment |
| 09 | The Principle | KEY LINE — "Build operations where your people come home" |
| 10 | The Choice | S.P. Easter egg placement |
| 13 | Watcher Closing | Tease for S4E2 — Engineering Daisy visible |

## Specific Review Requests

1. **Uatu Design:** Does the new cosmic transparency description read clearly? Will Gemini understand "stars visible THROUGH his body"?

2. **May's Introduction (Slide 05):** Is your characterization accurate? Economy of words, weight of presence, the devastating one-liner?

3. **Hill's Introduction (Slide 06):** Does the "COULD vs SHOULD" moment land? Is her professional authority clear?

4. **Accessibility:** Will a non-comic reader follow the visual flow?

5. **Panel Density:** Any slides that feel overcrowded or need simplification?

6. **Character Consistency:** Are all character blocks complete and accurate?

## Notes

- Applied all 10 production rules
- Used updated Uatu block (v2.1 from Character Bible)
- Fixed your note on Elena's hair (for future episodes)
- Ross Butler locked as Agent Chen

Director wants to test in Gemini after your review. Your feedback will inform whether we need revisions before image generation.

Awaiting your assessment.
