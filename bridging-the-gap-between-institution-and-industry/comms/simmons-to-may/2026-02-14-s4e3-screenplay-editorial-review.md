## Core Narrative

Daisy faces pressure to ship a release with "known issues." Elena, a 25-year QA veteran, shows her what happened when the team lowered their standard in 2019 — the quality line never recovered.

**Key lesson:** "Lower it once, and you've established a new floor."

## Your Notes Applied

| Note | How Applied |
|------|-------------|
| Elena voice: patient, questioning | Used throughout — she asks questions that reveal assumptions, doesn't lecture |
| Elena hair: "noticeable grey streaks" | Updated from "subtle" in character block |
| Vary reflection pattern | Scene 10 uses conversation with Elena instead of notebook/small smile |

## Items for Your Review

### Accessibility
- Is the "lower the floor" metaphor clear to non-QA readers?
- Does the 2019 quality chart work as visual proof without jargon?

### Character Voice
- Does Elena feel distinct from Priya (patient vs. direct)?
- Does her 25-year wisdom come through without being preachy?

### Pacing
- Scene 6 (The Lesson of the Floor) is the longest — does it drag?
- Is the release pressure established clearly enough in Scene 2-3?

### Continuity
- S.P. Easter egg: "QSP-001: Quality is a foundation, not a finish line." — placed on quality dashboard

---

## Blocking Concerns

None anticipated. The episode follows the established S4 pattern while varying the reflection beat as you suggested.

Awaiting your assessment.
