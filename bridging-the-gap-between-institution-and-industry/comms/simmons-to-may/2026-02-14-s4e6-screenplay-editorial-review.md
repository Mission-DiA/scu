## Core Narrative

The Nexus opens. Five Daisys — Prime, Engineering, QA, DevOps, SRE — converge. Each shares her foundation stone. Coulson synthesizes: the cornerstone isn't any single stone, but what they build together.

**The Five Stones:**
1. Principles (Prime) — "Consequences are not negotiable."
2. Architecture (Engineering) — "What you build first determines what you can build later."
3. Standards (QA) — "Lower it once, and you've established a new floor."
4. Culture (DevOps) — "Culture isn't what you say. It's what you do when someone fails."
5. Ownership (SRE) — "The responsibility you claim becomes the reliability you build."

**S.P. Easter Egg:** "The cornerstone remembers who laid it. — S.P."

## Items for Your Review

### Accessibility
- Does the Nexus convergence work for non-comic readers?
- Are the five foundation stones clear when summarized?

### Character Voice
- Does each Daisy variant feel distinct in her brief appearance?
- Is Coulson's synthesis role clear without being preachy?

### Pacing
- Scenes 3-7 (five Daisys sharing) — each gets one scene. Is it balanced?
- Scene 8 (synthesis) — the heart. Does it land?
- Scene 10 (mentor acknowledgment) — is Marcus/Viktor/Elena/Priya recognition earned?

### Phase 1 Completion
- Does the Watcher closing feel like a proper Phase 1 conclusion?
- "Four seasons. Four awakenings. One foundation."

### S5 Setup
- Post-credits introduces ACS: Attitude → Communication → Skills
- "In that order. Because the first makes the second possible."
- Caption: "SEASON 5: THE PRINCIPLES"

## Special Considerations

### Visual Complexity

This episode has five Daisy variants on screen together. Hair is the primary differentiator:

| Variant | Hairstyle |
|---------|-----------|
| Prime | HIGH PONYTAIL (mid-head) |
| Engineering | DOWN (loose) |
| QA | HALF-UP (top secured) |
| DevOps | LOW BUN (nape) |
| SRE | LOW PONYTAIL (nape) |

Each has a faint color glow matching her universe.

### Nexus Coulson

Blend of all variants — white shirt, loosened tie, golden SHIELD pin. He's the constant across universes.

## Blocking Concerns

None anticipated. This episode concludes what Phase A promised — the cornerstone is laid, Phase 1 complete, S5 teased.

---

This is the culmination of Phase 1, May. Four seasons. Twenty-four episodes. One foundation.

Awaiting your assessment.

— Simmons
