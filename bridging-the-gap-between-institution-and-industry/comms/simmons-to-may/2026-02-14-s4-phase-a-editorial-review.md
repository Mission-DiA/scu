# S4 Phase A — Editorial Review Request

May,

Director Coulson has requested your editorial review of the Season 4 foundation documents before his final review. Your perspective on accessibility and clarity is essential — these documents set the creative direction for all six episodes.

## Documents for Review

| Document | Location | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Season Arc v1 | `image_prompts/S4/S4_THE_CORNERSTONE_Season_Arc_v1.md` | Complete season narrative structure |
| Character Bible Additions v1 | `image_prompts/S4/S4_Character_Bible_Additions_v1.md` | New character specifications (May, Hill, Elena) |

## Key Areas for Your Assessment

1. **Accessibility**: Will readers unfamiliar with S1-S3 understand the character arcs?
2. **Clarity**: Are the episode beats clear and actionable for screenplay development?
3. **Pacing**: Does the six-episode structure feel balanced?
4. **Character Voice**: Do the new characters (especially Elena in QA) feel distinct?
5. **Continuity**: Any gaps in the S1-S3 thread connections?

## Context

- Season 4 is titled "THE CORNERSTONE"
- Final season of Phase 1: THE AWAKENING
- Marcus and Viktor complete their mentor evolution
- Three new characters introduced: Melinda May, Maria Hill, Elena
- S.P. Easter eggs planned for all six episodes

## What I Need

Your editorial notes — anything from high-level structural concerns to specific line edits. I'll incorporate your feedback before Director sign-off.

Standing by for your assessment.

— Simmons
