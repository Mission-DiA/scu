# S4E2 THE DEBT — Editorial Review Request

May,

S4E2 screenplay is complete. Requesting your editorial review before Director sign-off.

## Document for Review

| Document | Location |
|----------|----------|
| S4E2 Complete Screenplay v1 | `image_prompts/S4/S4E2_THE_DEBT_Screenplay_v1.md` |

## Episode Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Universe | Engineering (Green #00FF41) |
| Title | THE DEBT |
| Theme | Technical architecture, avoiding debt |
| Core Conflict | Quick fix vs. sustainable investment |
| Scenes | 12 |

## Key Story Beats

1. **Watcher Opening** — Technical debt as compounding interest
2. **The Two Paths** — 3 days (patch) vs. 2 weeks (rebuild)
3. **Reena's Question** — "How do you get Marcus to notice your code?"
4. **Marcus's Architecture Doc** — Visual proof of compound debt
5. **S.P.'s First Law** — "What you build first determines what you can build later."
6. **Coulson's Translation** — "What you build into the system, you build into yourself."
7. **S.P. Easter Egg** — On Marcus's architecture doc

## Key Areas for Your Assessment

1. **Marcus's Evolution**: Does his shift from S1 warning to S4 mentor feel earned? Is his 10% desaturation properly noted?
2. **Reena's Moment**: Does her question land without over-explaining Marcus's status?
3. **Technical Accessibility**: Will non-engineers understand "technical debt" through the architecture diagram?
4. **Pacing**: 12 scenes — does it breathe?
5. **Coulson vs. Marcus**: Are their teaching roles distinct? (Marcus = domain expertise, Coulson = career wisdom)

## New Character

| Character | Actor | Role |
|-----------|-------|------|
| Reena | Priyanka Chopra Jonas | Junior engineer, asks the key question |

## What I Need

Your editorial notes — structural concerns, dialogue adjustments, pacing issues. I'll incorporate feedback before Director review.

Standing by for your assessment.
