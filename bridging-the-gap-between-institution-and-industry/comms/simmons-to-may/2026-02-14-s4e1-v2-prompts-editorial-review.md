topic: S4E1 v2 FULL DEPTH Prompts — Editorial Review Required
urgency: request
status: open
---

May,

S4E1 prompts have been completely redone. Requesting your editorial review on v2.

## Why the Redo

Director tested v1 (15 slides) in Gemini and raised a critical question: **Why did we condense 73 screenplay panels to 15 slides?**

My reasoning was flawed. I followed the S1-S3 pattern (~15 slides per episode) assuming practical limits and "key moments" were sufficient. Director disagreed:

> "I don't mind having as many slides as possible to capture the depth we crafted in screenplays. That is why we do this meticulously where we develop the story arc, step by step right."

He's right. We don't do meticulous screenplay work just to compress it. The depth IS the point.

## What Changed

| Version | Slides | Panels Captured | Approach |
|---------|--------|-----------------|----------|
| v1 | 15 | ~20 (key moments) | Condensed |
| **v2** | **42** | **73 (all)** | **Full Depth** |

Every scene, every panel, every beat from the screenplay is now represented.

## Deliverable Location

`image_prompts/S4/prompts/S4E1_THE_PRINCIPLE_Gemini_Prompts_v2.md`

## What to Review

1. **Completeness:** Does v2 capture the full screenplay depth? Any panels missed?

2. **Panel-to-Slide Mapping:** I used 1-2 screenplay panels per slide. Does the grouping feel natural?

3. **Key Moments:** Are these preserved with appropriate weight?
   - Slide 14: May's "Cost two agents"
   - Slide 17: Hill's "COULD vs SHOULD"
   - Slide 28: THE PRINCIPLE line
   - Slide 33: S.P. Easter Egg placement

4. **Character Consistency:** Full character blocks in every prompt. Any drift?

5. **Dialogue Flow:** V.O. vs speech bubbles correctly assigned?

6. **S4E2 Tease:** Engineering Daisy (hair DOWN, grey hoodie) clearly differentiated from Prime Daisy?

## Production Compliance

All 10 rules applied throughout:
- One dialogue per speaker per panel
- Full character blocks (no lazy references)
- Full bleed specified
- 1-2px panel lines
- Coulson above Daisy
- Universe color (Blue #4A90D9)
- No unnecessary props
- Foreground positioning
- Seated/standing explicit
- Uatu cosmic transparency (v2.1 block)

## Context for Future Episodes

If v2 passes review, this becomes our template for S4E2-S4E6. Full depth, not condensed. The screenplay IS the script — the prompts should honor that.

Awaiting your assessment.
