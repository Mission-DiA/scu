# S4E1 THE PRINCIPLE — Editorial Review Request

May,

S4E1 screenplay is complete. Requesting your editorial review before Director sign-off.

## Document for Review

| Document | Location |
|----------|----------|
| S4E1 Complete Screenplay v1 | `image_prompts/S4/S4E1_THE_PRINCIPLE_Screenplay_v1.md` |

## Episode Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Universe | Prime (Blue #4A90D9) |
| Title | THE PRINCIPLE |
| Theme | Principles that guide decisions |
| Core Conflict | Expedient path vs. principled path |
| Scenes | 13 |

## Key Story Beats

1. **Watcher Opening** — Foundation stones, the weight of choices
2. **May's Line** — "I once took the fast route. Saved six hours. Cost two agents."
3. **Hill's Question** — "I'm not asking what you COULD do. I'm asking what you SHOULD do."
4. **Coulson's Guidance** — "The principle isn't 'be fast.' The principle is 'build operations where your people come home.'"
5. **Daisy's Choice** — Chooses Beta (slower, safer) over Alpha (faster, riskier)
6. **S.P. Easter Egg** — "Foundation Review: S.P." on mission report footer

## Key Areas for Your Assessment

1. **Accessibility**: Will readers unfamiliar with Prime Universe follow the mission context?
2. **Character Voice**: Do May, Hill, and Coulson each sound distinct?
3. **Pacing**: Does the episode breathe, or does it feel rushed?
4. **May's Delivery**: Does her one-line hit with enough weight? (Economy of words, maximum impact)
5. **Hill's Role**: Does she feel like organizational accountability, not an obstacle?
6. **Thematic Clarity**: Is the "principle vs. expedience" choice clear without being preachy?

## Notes from Your Phase A Review

You flagged no blocking issues for S4E1, but noted:
- May's costume in low-light: may need blue ambient glow for visibility
- (This applies to Gemini prompts phase, not screenplay)

## What I Need

Your editorial notes — structural concerns, dialogue adjustments, pacing issues. I'll incorporate feedback before Director review.

Standing by for your assessment.
