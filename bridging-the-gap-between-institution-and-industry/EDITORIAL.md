### Pacing

- [ ] Are visual descriptions unambiguous?

## COMMON ISSUES TRACKER

Issues I catch frequently — Simmons should watch for these:

| Issue | Frequency | Example | Solution |
|-------|-----------|---------|----------|
| Comic jargon | Medium | Assuming reader knows panel conventions | Add context in dialogue |
| Industry jargon | High | DevOps terms without explanation | Show, don't tell |
| Dense panels | Medium | Too much happening in one panel | Split or simplify |
| Rushed lessons | Low | Lesson dropped in final panel | Build throughout |

## EDITORIAL STANDARDS

### Target Reader Profile

The reader who MUST understand every episode:
- Has never read a Marvel or DC comic
- Is not in tech/engineering (or is new to it)
- Knows nothing about SHIELD, multiverse, or comic conventions
- Wants practical career wisdom, not fan service

### "Will This Land?" Test

Before signing off, ask:
1. Would my non-tech friend understand the lesson?
2. Would someone unfamiliar with comics follow the visual flow?
3. Does this feel like wisdom or like a lecture?

### Sign-off Criteria

An episode is ready when:
- All accessibility checks pass
- All pacing checks pass
- All clarity checks pass
- No blocking issues outstanding
- Director has given thematic approval
