- [ ] Is the lesson understandable without industry context?
- [ ] Do panels flow logically without comic-reading experience?

### Pacing
- [ ] Does every panel serve the story?
- [ ] Are there panels that could be cut?
- [ ] Do emotional beats breathe?
- [ ] Is the lesson rushed or dragged?

### Clarity
- [ ] Is dialogue natural?
- [ ] Is the core lesson clear by episode end?
- [ ] Are visual descriptions unambiguous?
- [ ] Will Gemini understand what to generate?

## COMMON ISSUES TRACKER

Issues I catch frequently — Simmons should watch for these:

| Issue | Frequency | Example | Solution |
|-------|-----------|---------|----------|
| Comic jargon | Medium | Assuming reader knows panel conventions | Add context in dialogue |
| Industry jargon | High | DevOps terms without explanation | Show, don't tell |
| Dense panels | Medium | Too much happening in one panel | Split or simplify |
| Rushed lessons | Low | Lesson dropped in final panel | Build throughout |

## EDITORIAL STANDARDS

### FULL DEPTH Standard (CRITICAL)

> **Established:** 2026-02-14 (Director order after S4E1 v1 feedback)
> **Principle:** "The depth IS the point."

**What This Means for Editorial:**

When reviewing Gemini prompts, verify FULL DEPTH is maintained:

| Check | Pass | Fail |
|-------|------|------|
| Panel-to-slide ratio | 1-2 panels per slide | 4+ panels per slide |
| Screenplay coverage | All panels represented | "Key moments only" |
| Scene representation | Proportional (7 panels → 4 slides) | Compressed (7 panels → 1 slide) |
| Key moments | Single-panel treatment | Grouped with other beats |

**Red Flags:**
- ~15 slides from 70+ screenplay panels = COMPRESSION (reject)
- "Summarized" scenes = DEPTH LOST (reject)
- Multiple scenes per slide = OVER-CONDENSED (reject)

**Approved Template:** S4E1 v2 (42 slides from 73 panels)

**Why This Matters:**
Director feedback on S4E1 v1: "Why did we condense 73 panels to 15 slides? We do meticulous screenplay work specifically to capture that depth."

### Target Reader Profile

The reader who MUST understand every episode:
- Has never read a Marvel or DC comic
- Is not in tech/engineering (or is new to it)
- Knows nothing about SHIELD, multiverse, or comic conventions
- Wants practical career wisdom, not fan service

### "Will This Land?" Test

Before signing off, ask:
1. Would my non-tech friend understand the lesson?
2. Would someone unfamiliar with comics follow the visual flow?
3. Does this feel like wisdom or like a lecture?

### Sign-off Criteria

An episode is ready when:
- All accessibility checks pass
- All pacing checks pass
- All clarity checks pass
- No blocking issues outstanding
- Director has given thematic approval
