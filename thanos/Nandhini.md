# THE CAREER BLUEPRINT CHALLENGE

### Season 2: Build Career, Not Just Get Job

---

> **"'I want a job' is survival. 'I want to build my career' is the appropriate statement."**
> — The Watcher, S2E6

You've read Season 2. Six episodes. Six universes. Six lessons.

Now it's your turn. This isn't a quiz about the story — it's about YOUR career. The same questions Coulson asked Daisy, you'll answer about yourself. No hiding behind "right-sounding" answers. Be specific. Be honest. Be brutal.

**Deadline:** 1 week from today
**Time needed:** 60-90 minutes of genuine reflection
**What happens after:** You will present Phase 6 (Your Architecture) to the team and defend it. Your colleagues will ask the tough questions.

## PHASE 1: THE FOUNDATION AUDIT

*From S2E1 — "That's what you finished. What did you build?"*

Coulson showed Daisy two agents. Same start date. Same effort. Different results. Agent A completed tasks. Agent B built systems, trained people, created frameworks.

### Q1. List your top 5 accomplishments from the last 6 months.

| # | Accomplishment                                                                                                                         |
| - | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | Achieved ~60% automation coverage for a major module, including all sanity and high-impact test cases.                                 |
| 2 | Initiated feature-level automation to prevent future automation backlog and improve release efficiency.                                |
| 3 | Implemented automated chat notifications for Sparrow runs with execution details and result links, improving visibility.               |
| 4 | Initiated to develop slash-command integration in Space chat to trigger Sparrow runs with parameters, streamlining execution workflow. |
| 5 | Strengthened defect debugging and root cause analysis, contributing impactful ideas in technical discussions.                          |

### Q2. Now be honest — for each one, mark it:

- **C** = Completed (you did the work, it's done, nothing remains)
- **B** = Built (it continues to create value without you actively doing it)

| # | C or B? | Why?                                                                                                           |
| - | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | B       | I finished the 60% goal for the main cases. I am now adding more cases while also handling my other new tasks. |
| 2 | B       | Since we have taking up the feature recently i have started with that feature automation                       |
| 3 | B       | The tool is built. I am just making some final small changes based on feedback before it goes live             |
| 4 | B       | Cureently working on that and fine-tuning how it works                                                         |
| 5 | C       | My better debugging and ideas help the team solve problems faster every day.                                   |

### Q3. If you disappeared tomorrow, which of those 5 things would still matter in 6 months? Why?

```
[The Test Suite: The 60% automation I built will continue to run every day, catching bugs and protecting the module even if I'm not there to click "start. The Notifications: The automated chat alerts are a "set it and forget it" win. The team will still be getting instant results and links in their chat apps every time a test runs.]
```

### Q4. What is your career INTENTION right now? Not your job title. Not your task list. What are you actively, deliberately building?

```
[My intention is to transform from a task-executor into a force multiplier. I believe AI doesn't just reduce work; it creates the space to handle multiple high-value workstreams simultaneously. I am deliberately building a highly automated ecosystem where my ideas—not my manual hours—are the primary driver of progress]

What I am actively, deliberately building:
A 'Strategy-First' Workflow: Shifting the focus from writing code to designing systems. I am building the infrastructure that allows me to implement new ideas as fast as I can think of them.
Automated Intelligence: Creating tools that don't just 'run' but 'report and analyze,' giving me the data I need to make faster, smarter technical decisions.
```

> **Gut check:** If you struggled to answer Q4, that IS the answer.

## PHASE 2: THE LOOP MAP

*From S2E2 — "You're shipping. You're not looping."*

Coulson showed Daisy the D3O loop: **Design → Develop → Deploy → Operate → back to Design.** She'd been stuck in Develop → Deploy. Shipping other people's designs. Never hearing what happened after.

### Q5. Think about your last major project or initiative. Map it to the D3O loop:

| D3O Stage                                                       | What YOU Did (be specific)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | What SOMEONE ELSE Did                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Design** (deciding WHAT to build and WHY)               | About a month ago I noticed developers rarely checked the Jenkins dashboard, so automation failures were often noticed late. I decided to send Jenkins build results directly to a Google Chat channel called “Automation result” so the team could immediately see the status without opening Jenkins. | Jenkins pipelines and automation suites were already maintained by the QA and engineering teams. |
| **Develop** (building / executing it)                     | I built the integration using a Google Chat webhook. The message included build status, duration, test suites, environment link, Allure report, and screenshots. Version 1 only sent basic status. In version 2 I added test health insights and module-level failure counts to make debugging easier.    | Developers maintained the pipeline and fixed issues when failures were reported.                 |
| **Deploy** (shipping / releasing / presenting it)         | I connected the webhook to the Jenkins pipeline so every build automatically posts a summary to the Automation result channel. This made the results visible to the team immediately after execution.                                                                                                     | Developers and QA used the notifications to quickly access reports and investigate failures.     |
| **Operate** (monitoring, learning from results, feedback) | After multiple runs, the notifications showed that most recurring failures were in UI tests, highlighting weaker areas in the automation suite. One gap is that it currently reports failures but does not track long-term trends like flaky tests.                                                       | Developers used the reports to debug failing tests or code issues.                               |

### Q6. Look at your map. Which stages are you dominant in? Which are empty?

```
I’m strongest in the Design and Develop stages. I identified that Jenkins results were not being monitored consistently and built a Google Chat webhook integration to surface build results. I also contributed to Deploy by connecting it to the Jenkins pipeline for automated notifications. Operate is the weakest stage, as the system improves visibility but does not yet track long-term trends like flaky tests.
```

### Q7. Coulson told Daisy: "AI can do Develop-Deploy faster than any human now." What parts of YOUR work could AI do today? What parts require your judgment, your relationships, your context?

```
AI could generate the webhook integration script and format the notification payload. However, the key decision was recognizing the real problem. Jenkins results already existed, but developers were not checking the dashboard regularly. Moving the information to Google Chat required understanding the team’s workflow. I also had to decide what information to highlight in the notification, such as module failures and recurring test issues, so the team could quickly identify problems.
```

### Q8. When was the last time you shipped something that YOU designed — not something assigned to you?

```
Last month I started working on the Jenkins to Google Chat automation notification integration. The goal is to post a summary of each pipeline run in a shared chat channel with build status, test suites executed, report links, and failure insights. The first version currently sends only the basic build status. I’m still in the development phase and working on improving it by adding test health insights and recurring failure summaries so the team can quickly identify problem areas once it is fully deployed.
```

---

## PHASE 3: THE SELF-TEST

*From S2E3 — "You have test plans for every feature. What's the test plan for your career?"*

Daisy had 94% automated coverage on her products and 0% on her own career. Coulson asked: "Would you ship a product with that test plan?"

### Q9. Where do you want to be in 2 years? (Be specific — title, responsibility, skill level)

[In two years, I aim to grow into a Senior QA / Quality Engineer role with strong involvement in AI-driven testing and team leadership. I want to build deeper expertise in AI-assisted test automation
Along with technical growth, I want to take on more leadership responsibilities
My goal is to move beyond executing tests and start **leading quality initiatives**, designing smarter automation systems, and helping the team make better engineering decisions around quality and reliability.
]

### Q10. Now write the acceptance criteria. How will you KNOW you're ready? Not "I feel ready" — measurable criteria.

| # | Acceptance Criteria                                                                                                                                        | Current Status (Met / Partially / Not Met) |
| - | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 1 | Use my code access to investigate issues, identify the root cause in the code, and guide developers by pointing to the exact place where the issue occurs. | Partially                                  |
| 2 | Build or integrate AI-based tools that reduce manual effort and repetitive testing tasks in the QA workflow                                                | Partially                                  |
| 3 | Contribute ideas and strategy during discussions to help the team improve testing, automation, and overall quality practices.                              | Partially                                  |
| 4 | Improve and complete the full automation suite with the help of AI so that most critical flows are automated and easier to maintain.                       | Not Met                                    |

### Q11. What are your edge cases — the risks that could derail your career path?

| # | Edge Case / Risk                                                                                                        | Mitigation Plan                                                                                                                                                        |
| - | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | Not improving enough in AI tools and automation, which could make my skills outdated as testing becomes more AI-driven. | Continuously learn and experiment with AI tools, build small internal tools, and apply them to reduce manual testing tasks.                                            |
| 2 | Staying only in execution-based QA work without contributing to design or strategy discussions.                         | Actively participate in technical discussions, share ideas for improving automation and testing workflows, and take ownership of small quality initiatives.            |
| 3 | Difficulty in debugging issues at the code level even after getting code access                                         | Spend time understanding the codebase, read developer fixes, practice debugging, and collaborate closely with developers to learn how issues are identified and fixed. |

### Q12. Coulson asked Daisy: "Would you ship a product with that test plan?" Looking at your answers above — would YOU?

I would ship it, but I know it’s not complete yet. The direction is clear — improving in AI-driven testing, strengthening automation, and taking more leadership in quality decisions. However, some parts are still in progress, like building more AI-based tools, improving the automation suite, and getting more comfortable debugging issues in the codebase.

So I would say the plan is good enough to start with, but it will need continuous improvement as I gain more experience and take on more responsibility.

---

## PHASE 4: THE MENTOR MAP

*From S2E4 — "You don't have to be an expert to help someone. You just have to be one step ahead."*

Viktor was scared his advice wasn't good enough. It was fumbling, confusing, imperfect — and it was exactly what Daisy needed. Because he was one step ahead.

### Q13. Who are you ONE STEP AHEAD of right now? (Name a real person or describe the type of person — a junior colleague, a new hire, someone in another team.)

```
[Since I am the junior in the house I currently don’t have any juniors to mentor However, I can still describe the kind of person I would like to guide. At the same time, I feel that mentorship should not be limited only to juniors even seniors can sometimes benefit from another perspective While they may have already walked the path before I did I can still contribute by pointing out things like, “this might have been missed,” or “this could also have been approached in a different way.”

Coming to the main point, when a fresher steps into the IT industry, they don’t need to be perfect from the beginning. What truly matters is having confidence in what they do, along with curiosity and passion for the work. Since I have gone through that stage myself, I can relate to it well. It is also important not to feel shy about asking questions or seeking to learn new things ]
```

### Q14. What specific thing could you teach or share with them THIS week? Not next quarter. This week.

```
[What I would teach them is to have an open mind to learn. There are so many things to explore, and they should be happy to learn from juniors, seniors, or anyone around them. If they have that mindset, they will naturally grow and shine.

In the initial stage itself, I would also set some clarity about time management and encourage them to be confident in what they do. Another important thing I would emphasize is not to postpone the work that has been taken up. Whether it gets completed perfectly or not is okay, because even during the process there will be good progress and learning. So being clear about these things from the beginning will help, and the rest will fall into place smoothly.]]
```

### Q15. What has STOPPED you from mentoring or sharing so far? Be honest — is it time, fear of being wrong, not feeling expert enough, or something else?

```
[In the initial stage, what stopped me from mentoring or sharing was fear — especially the fear of being wrong. But now it is not the same anymore. From my experience, what I have gained is confidence. I realized that whatever I know, I should share, because it helps others learn as well. At the same time, it also gives me a chance to correct myself if I am wrong]
```

### Q16. Viktor said: "What if my advice is wrong? I'm still figuring this out myself." Have you ever held back from helping someone because you didn't feel qualified? What happened?

```
[No, I didn’t step back because of that. Yes, of course I had some fear, but it never stopped me from sharing or mentoring. Anyway, I continued to do it.]
```

---

## PHASE 5: THE PREVENTION AUDIT

*From S2E5 — "You're not building your replacement. You're building your ladder."*

Daisy had the fastest incident response on the team. Three SEV-1s in a month, all handled under 4 minutes. Same root cause. She was winning battles in a war she never tried to end.

### Q17. What are you doing repeatedly at work that you could prevent, automate, or delegate? List 3 recurring tasks that eat your time.

| # | Recurring Task | How Often | Could Be: Prevented / Automated / Delegated? |
| - | -------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 1 |    Triaging production incidents that follow the same repetitive patterns.            |     Frequently      |       Automated: I can build scripts to auto-debug and assign these or even auto-resolve simple ones.                                       |
| 2 |       Manual regression and feature testing for every small change.         |      Every Release     |           Automated: These are easily scriptable to save time and ensure consistency.                                   |
| 3 |         Gathering QA metrics and generating reports manually       |     Weekly/Monthly      |     Automated: There should be zero manual effort here; data should pull into a dashboard automatically                                         |

### Q18. If you automated or delegated those 3 things, what would you do with the freed time? (Not "more of the same" — what HIGHER problem would you work on?)

```
[I’d move away from just 'finding' bugs and start designing the strategy to prevent them. Instead of being stuck in the details of manual triaging or reports, I’d use that freed time to look at the big picture—identifying gaps in our system logic and building smarter, AI-assisted workflows. Basically, I want to spend my time on the ideas that make us faster, rather than the manual tasks that slow us down.]
```

### Q19. Are you a firefighter or an architect right now? Firefighters fight the same fires forever. Architects automate the known to hunt the unknown.

```
[Right now, I’m moving from Firefighter to Architect I still jump in to fix urgent issues manually when they pop up but I’m shifting my focus toward building self-healing systems tools that catch and handle these problems automatically so they don't need my constant attention.

What needs to change: I need to finish the automation tools I'm building now. Once those are live, I can stop focusing on repetitive manual tasks and spend my time on the bigger technical strategy.]
```

### Q20. What's your biggest fear about automating or delegating your current work? Is it that you'll be replaced, or is it something else?

```
[My fear isn’t that I'll be replaced it’s actually the opposite. My real fear is staying stuck. If I don't automate the boring parts of my job, I’ll be trapped doing the same repetitive tasks while the rest of the industry moves forward.

I want to 'replace' my current self with a more efficient version of me someone who isn't bogged down by manual work. My goal is to automate the 'busy work' so I can spend my time on the actual ideas and strategy that bring real value to the team.]
```

---

## PHASE 6: YOUR ARCHITECTURE

*From S2E6 — "You are the architect. In every universe. Build accordingly."*

This is the one you'll present to the team. All five phases led here.

### Q21. YOUR CAREER BLUEPRINT

Fill in your personal architecture. Be specific — no vague aspirations.

### Q22. What is the ONE THING you will do differently starting this week — not this quarter, not "eventually" — THIS WEEK?

```
[Starting this week, I am setting aside the first hour of my day specifically for 'Architect Work'—finishing the automation tools that eliminate my manual tasks. Instead of jumping straight into fixing daily bugs or 'fires,' I will prioritize the work that stops those fires from happening in the first place. I’m committing to making progress on my ideas before I get pulled into the routine work.]
```

## FINAL REFLECTION

### Q24. Which episode hit you the hardest? Why?

```
[Episode 3 – Testing Your Career Like a System.

As QA I always think about testing, monitoring, and improving systems. But I realized I never applied the same thinking to my own career. I’ve mostly focused on finishing work rather than intentionally planning my growth, And this made me to realise to move forward and this help to how to think and make my regular task more simplier . i used to do the usual task like debugging the issue and givving it teh dev for fix but now i myslef planning to and started to do fix ]
```

### Q25. Was there a specific scene or dialogue that made you stop and think about your own work life? Describe the moment and what it triggered in you.

```
[“This is the era of Vibe Engineering. You’re at the controls. Tell it what to build, watch it work, course-correct when it drifts.”
What caught my attention was the idea that engineers should act like directors of the system. It made me realize that sometimes I focus too much on completing tasks instead of thinking about how the work is actually moving things forward.]
```

### Q26. If you had to explain Season 2 to a colleague who hasn't read it — not the plot, but why it matters — what would you tell them?

```
[I would say Season 2 is about treating your career like an engineering system.

We spend a lot of time doing regular task and improving systems, but rarely step back and think about our own growth. The season pushes you to reflect on whether you’re just staying busy or actually making meaningful progress.]
```

### Q27. What did Season 2 make you feel or realize that Season 1 didn't? What changed between reading the first season and finishing this one?

```
[Season 1 focused more on understanding work and growth and also decision making 
Season 2 made me realize that growth doesn’t happen automatically — it needs conscious effort, reflection, and direction.

It pushed me to think more seriously about the long-term path of my career, not just the tasks I’m doing today.]
```

### Q28. If you were creating Season 3, what would you keep exactly as is — and what would you do differently?

**Keep as is:**

```
[Keep as is:
The storytelling style and conversations between characters. It makes complex ideas about career growth easier to relate to.]
```

**Do differently:**

```
[Add more real examples so we can directly apply the ideas to their own work situations.]
```

### Q29. Which question in this blueprint was the hardest to answer? What does that tell you?

```
[Q20 (The Fear) or PREVENTION.
What it tells you: It shows i have outgrown your current routine. Most people fear being replaced by AI I fear getting stuck doing work that doesn't matter anymore. It proves my mindset has transforming into an architect i have ready to lead the strategy, not just follow the script]
```

**Submit to:** Director Coulson
**Deadline:** [11-03-2026]
